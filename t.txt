PART ONE

Why I Write Horror

“So, why do you write horror?”
It's a question I've thought about a lot over the years, and it might surprise you to learn that I don't have a definite answer—or at least not a single answer. I can, however, pinpoint specific moments in my life that led me to my love affair with all things dark and wonderful.
When I was a child—maybe four or five—my dad would sit me on his lap and read nonfiction books about dinosaurs to me. I couldn't read their names, but I learned to recognize the words by their shapes, almost as if they were pictographs. I was fascinated by the idea that these massive monsters had been real, that they had actually existed and might have walked the same ground as where my house now stood. More than real life monsters, they were also like ghosts—spirits of creatures who'd died long ago but still lingered, in the human imagination if nowhere else.
Around the same time, I watched Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man with my parents. My morn and dad didn't censor what I watched back then. If they watched it, I did, too. I was fascinated by the idea that these two monsters—both of which I knew starred in their own movies—not only inhabited the same universe but could actually meet, interact, and—best of all—battle to the death. After the movie, my dad taught me a simple way to draw the Wolf Man, and I still remember how to do it to this day, fifty years later.
When I was five, a friend showed me a book by Norman Bridwell, of Clifford the Big Red Dog fame. The book was How to Train Your Monster, and it was a guide for keeping a monster as your pet. I was desperate to have this book, and I traded my friend a bunch of baseball cards for it. (To this day, it’s still one of the best deals I ever made.) In first grade, I entered a contest to win tickets to see a high school play called The Ghoul Friend. I really wanted to see the play—after all, it had ghoul in the title—and when I won, I was ecstatic. The play turned out to be a Scooby-Doo-type story with no real monsters in it, but the costumes were great. 
As I grew, so too did my love of horror. I watched the weekly local horror movie program on TV—Shock Theater with Dr. Creep—religiously. I read Eerie Publications’ black-and-white horror comics, magazines with lurid, blood-soaked covers and titles like Tales of Voodoo, Terror Tales and Tales from the Tomb. And I devoured Warren Publishing’s horror magazines such as Creepy, Eerie, Vampirella, and the monster kid’s bible, Famous Monsters of Filmland. I loved DC Comics like House of Mystery and House of Secrets, and Marvel Comics like Tomb of Dracula and Werewolf by Night. For my birthday and Christmases, I asked for monster toys instead of bikes or sports equipment, and the first horror story I wrote was a comic-book version of King Kong vs, Godzilla—a film which I knew existed but had never seen—drawn on a stenographer's pad.
I started reading a lot of UFO and cryptid nonfiction books, my imagination captivated by the idea that these beings might actually exist. The book that had the most effect on me was john A. Keel’s The Mothman Prophecies, especially the last line, a quote attributed to Charles Fort: “If there is a universal mind, must it be sane?" That idea haunted me, and it's formed the basis of much of my horror fiction throughout my life.
As I headed toward my teenage years, I read about Richard Matheson’s I Am Legend, and Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire, and I was thrilled to discover my local library had both. When I was in fifth grade, my father took me to see jaws, and I was traumatized by the film's unbearable suspense. I've had a love-hate relationship with sharks ever since. In seventh grade a friend told me about this really good book he was reading—Salem’s Lot by Stephen King. I got a copy and had never been so captivated by a story. Several years later, I would read an interview with King in the black-and»white horror magazine Dracula Lives, and I'd realize being a writer was something a person could choose to do, and I could choose it as well if I wanted.
In high school, right before Thanksgiving break one year, the faculty herded the students into the gym and showed us Psycho while they all went outside and smoked. I couldn't understand what the hell the teachers were thinking—Psycho wasn't exactly a family-friendly, holiday—themed movie—but I loved it. After high school I got to see the best (and not-so-best) eighties horror films in the theater, and when videotape players came on the market, I rented and watched every horror movie I could find.
I started writing seriously with the goal of becoming published when I was eighteen. By this time, I was reading more fantasy and science fiction than horror, and while Itriecl my hand at all three genres when it came to short fiction, for some reason I only tried to write fantasy and science fiction at novel length. This was during the legendary 1980's horror boom in publishing, and I sometimes wonder what might’ve happened if I'd written a horror novel back then and sent it off to an agent or editor. I went to college, eventually graduating with a bachelor's in education and a master's in English. I continued writing novels and stories and racking up rejections. More and more I began to gravitate toward writing horror at short length, although I still didn't attempt to write a horror novel. I’m not sure why. Sometimes I think that I loved horror so much that I was too intimidated to attempt a novel, afraid that I might mess it up.
I began teaching college writing part-time to support myself while I wrote. I found Ramsey Campbell's excellent collection Alone with the Horrors in the library of a college where I was teaching, and after reading it from cover to cover, I gained a better understanding of how to write short horror fiction, and my stories improved immeasurably. By this point, I began selling short stories to small-press markets, and my first professionally published piece—and the one where I first found my horror voice—was "Mr. Punch," which appeared in the anthology YoungB1ood. By this point, the earliest form of online communities began to emerge, and I joined the genie network, where many writers of Scifi slash Fantasy slash Horror hung out. I got to read the posts of professional writers and interact with them online, but while I enjoyed them all, the horror writers felt the most like my people. We seemed to look at the world in similar ways and loved the same books and films. 
I began going to SF conventions and speaking on panels. This led me to join a writers‘ group with the novelists Dennis L. McKiernan and Lois McMaster Bujold. I got an agent, thanks to a recommendation from Dennis, and he began shopping around some of my fantasy novels, but with no luck. I continued selling short fiction-most often horror—to both pro and small-press markets, and I began to wonder if I could take the kind of “Tim Waggoner" horror story I'd developed and write a novel-length work of fiction using the same approach. By this time-my early thirties—I was reading more horror than anything else, and after reading Douglas Clegg's You Come When I Call You and Tom Piccirilli's A Lower Deep, I felt I had a grasp on how to write a novel-length Tim Waggoner horror story. The result was The Harmony Society, the first of many horror novels I would go on to publish.
I'm in my fifties now, and I've published close to fifty novels and seven short story collections, a majority of them horror. I've been a two-time finalist for the Shirley Jackson Award, and I've been nominated for the Bram Stoker Award three times and won once. I'm not sure what kind of standing I have in the horror community. I've had people refer to me as an elder statesman of horror, and while I hope I'm not too elder yet, I appreciate the compliment. So one answer to why I write horror is that I've loved it all my life, and I grew into the writer I am just as I've grown into the man I've become—bit by bit, moment by moment. But there are darker reasons, too.
My mother was a depressive agoraphobic, and she never received treatment for her mental illness. She would have fainting spells once a month or so, and to this day I still jump when I hear a loud noise in the house, afraid that someone has fallen. My parents, without really meaning to, taught me and my siblings that the world is a dangerous place, always out to get you, always to be feared. When I was nine, I almost drowned (which is why water figures in my horror stories so often), and a few months later, my great uncle—who was like a second father to me—died suddenly. I was plunged into a two-year depression during which I struggled to come to terms with death. There's a scene in the movie Earth vs. the Spider where we're shown the destruction of a town caused by a giant arachnid. We're shown a blonde-haired boy with glasses (who looked a lot like me) crying, the only survivor. I realized then that the monsters I loved so much killed people, and that they made the survivors feel the same way I felt about losing my uncle. I've never looked at monsters the same way since. Nuclear war with Russia (then the Soviet Union) was still a very real possibility, and more of my older relatives died, one after the other. The Vietnam War was still going on when I was a child, and when I was a teenager, the Reagan years came along with the attendant economic hardships. And, of course, AIDs arrived as well. I suffered (and still do) from depression—yay, genetics!—as well as anxiety. I married an emotionally distant woman, and we had two daughters who I love deeply. When my first daughter was a few months old, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer, and the idea that I might die and leave my child without her father—and that I might miss her growing up—terrified me. Luckily, the cancer was caught in time, and I was fine. My marriage fell apart, and my wife and I divorced. I dated a series of women—some nice, some extremely strange-and I eventually fell in love with a wonderful woman who'd suffered a great deal of abuse in her past. From her, I learned what real trauma is and the kind of courage and strength it takes to survive and overcome it.
Horror movies, books, and comics gave me a love of horror tropes. My experience of the darker aspects of life—which we all must contend with to a greater or lesser degree—gave me an understanding of the dark emotional core necessary for producing truly effective horror fiction. I write horror because it stimulates my imagination like no other kind of fiction, and it speaks to the dark things inside me that I struggle to understand and come to terms with. I've taught composition and creative writing at the college level full time for the last twenty years. One year, my department chair and I attended a conference in Minneapolis. After a day wandering around the city sightseeing instead of going to conference sessions, my boss and I sat down in the hotel lobby. I-Ie was a literary guy, the kind of person who only believes a book is worthy if it gets a positive review in the New York Times. He asked me, with honest puzzlement in his voice, why I wrote horror. I thought for a moment before answering.
“Do you remember the banana we passed, the one that was lying on the sidewalk?"
He didn't.
“We passed it several times today. At first it was fine, but as the day went on, people stepped on it, and it got more and more squashed. I noticed it every time, and I can describe exactly what it looked like each time I saw it. That's the reason I write horror: I see the squashed bananas.”
My favorite answer to “Why I write horror?” is from Stephen King. When asked why he wrote about gruesome subjects, King once said, “What makes you assume that I have a choice?” In other words, I didn't choose the horror life; the horror life chose me. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.

PART TWO

Why Do I Want to Help You to Write Horror

I was probably nineteen, and I was sitting on the front porch of my parents’ house, looking at the field of corn across the road. We lived in the country, and back then, there were no houses on the other side of the road, just farmland. I don’t remember what I was doing or thinking. Probably not much of either. It was around 5:30 p.m., and I saw my dad's car coming down the road. I wasn't waiting for him specifically, but I was glad to see him. I watched as he pulled into our gravel driveway, drove up to the house—leaving clouds of white dust in his wake—and parked. When he came up the front walk, I saw that he was holding a thin paper sack in his hand with the word Wilkie's on it. Wilkie's was a bookstore in downtown Dayton, and Dad would stop there every now and again and buy a magazine for me, usually a copy of Famous Monsters. But today he brought me something different.
“I thought you might like this," he said as he handed me the bag.
I took it and pulled out a copy of a magazine called Writer's Digest. I had no idea magazines about writing existed, and I was thrilled. Dad knew I’d started writing, but he was a man of few words and hadn't really said much about it. The fact that he’d bought me this magazine was a huge sign of encouragement from him. He went inside, and I stayed on the porch and read that issue of Writer's Digest from cover to cover. I especially enjoyed Lawrence Block’s column on fiction writing, and after subscribing to the magazine, it was the first thing I read each month. Eventually, I sought out Block’s books on writing and devoured those, and I learned more from his writing about writing than from any teacher or class I ever had.
I was excited when J.N. Williamson's Haw to Write Tales of Fantasy, Horror, and Science Fiction was published, and then William F. Nolan‘s How to Write Horror Fiction. These weren't just how-to-write books—they were books about writing the kind of fiction I loved to read! I devoured these books as well, and read them over and over, trying to learn as much as I possibly could from them.
After graduating with a master's degree in English, I began teaching college writing courses while I worked on my fiction. But early on, I began writing articles on writing, too. I published my first such article, “Using Rejection,” in the online magazine Word Museum in 1 99 7. I went on to publish articles in Scavengers Newsletter, Speculations, The SIWA Bulletin, Writers journal, Ohio Writer, and eventually Writer's Digest itself. I enjoyed writing these articles. Not only were they fun to write, they made me think more deeply about writing, and I learned a lot from doing them. In 201 1, I started a blog called Writing in the Dark—which, of course, is where the title of this book came from—and that's where I do most of my writing about writing these days. Sure, my blog is a means to promote my fiction, but that's of secondary interest to me. I like helping people. It's why I became a teacher and why I've remained a teacher all these years.
A while back, I was one of the authors published by Sowin Books. The publisher arranged for a number of us to attend the Horror Hound convention to help sell and sign books. I didn't want to bring simple swag for readers—stuff like bookmarks and promotional postcards that no one cares about. I wanted to give people something they might actually want. I decided to create a handout for people interested in writing horror, which I called “The Extremely Short Guide to Writing Horror." It was a ﬂop. Only a couple people took copies (although my fellow authors didl). But I'm a big believer in recycling information, so I used the handout as a post on my blog, and then later developed it into a PowerPoint presentation I used for writing workshops at cons. For years, I'd toyed with the idea of writing my own how-to book, but I never felt like I'd learned enough about writing to give me the authority to do so. As the years passed, I wrote more articles and gave more presentations about writing horror, and somewhere along the way I guess I decided I was ready. You're holding the result in your hands. 
My hope is that this book will provide new horror writers with the tools needed to produce original stories that are frightening, entertaining, and well-written. But I also hope seasoned pros will find something useful here as well—information and ideas that might get them thinking about horror in a new way, or maybe just infuse them with fresh energy and enthusiasm for the genre we all love.
At the end of each chapter you'll find exercises and writing prompts to help you sharpen your craft and hopefully inspire you. If you teach or conduct workshops yourself, feel free to use this material—or any material in this book, for that matter—in your classes and sessions. After all, we have to make sure the darkness spreads and infects future generations, don't we?
One more thing . . .
As you make your way through this book, you'll notice I've used some examples—like the movie Jaws—more than once. Maybe it's because I have a limited imagination. Or I'm lazy. Or maybe I think it's useful to see the same examples presented in different contexts.
Yeah, you're right. I’m probably just lazy.

VOICES FROM THE SHADOWS

As a creative writing teacher, I appreciate it when students want to take more classes from me, but I always urge them to take classes from other writers as well. There's more than one way to skin Poe's black cat, and the more perspectives you can get on writing, the better. Even if they sometimes contradict each other. Especially then. I consider teaching to be like setting out a buffet. It's my job to put as many tasty dishes out as I can for you to choose from. But I'm far from the only cook in the kitchen, nor am I the most accomplished. So for this book, I wanted to bring in some more cooks to help me out. But who to ask and what to ask them? If I were a beginning horror writer, what would I want to know? The answer to this last question was easy. I'd want to know everything. But I'm not a beginner. I'm a busy pro, and I know what it's like to be sent an interview with twenty questions, all of which require detailed, thoughtful answers. It's work, and even if I want to answer them, I've got so much work of my own to do that it’s hard to find the time. So I decided to create two simple questions for my interviews. What do you think makes good horror/dark fantasy/suspense, and what's the best advice you could give a beginning writer of horror/dark fantasy/suspense? And to make it even easier for people to respond, I'd tell them that I was only looking for short answers, just a couple sentences apiece (although they could write longer responses if they wished). And when I made that decision, I realized I could include more interviews in the book than I'd previously anticipated. A lot more. 
I asked as many people as I could think of to answer my questions, and while some regretted they were too busy to participate, most were kind enough to answer. I purposefully selected authors of many different types of horror—literary, extreme, supernatural, realistic, dark fantasy, pulp adventure . . . I wanted to make sure that the genre was represented in all its dark and glorious diversity. Brian Hodge called the bits of wisdom I gathered “ﬂash interviews,” which I think is a cool term. I originally thought about putting the interviews in their own chapter at the end of the book, but imagining myself as reading the book, I thought it would be more effective to have the interviews spread throughout the text. So I've included a few at the end of each chapter. They’re in no particular order, and I didn't select them to match whatever a particular chapter's topic was. In a way, they're a parallel mini-book of their own, a collection of some of horror’s best—seasoned veterans, newcomers on the rise, and those in between. Sometimes they reinforce each other‘s advice—such as Read a lot—but I think that just shows you how important these writers think a specific aspect of craft is. Sometimes their views contradict each other, and that’s great. The more viewpoints about horror that you’re exposed to, the more it clarifies your own ideas and values on writing the stuff. I hope you find these snatches of advice interesting and useful—I know I did.
So as you make your way through this book, listen to these Voices from the Shadows. They've got a lot of dark and sinister wisdom to share.
