<txt id="fsz13pt"> 
<b>MONSTER IN THE HOUSE</b>
<br>What do jaws, The Exorcist, and Alien have in common? They're examples of the genre I call "Monster in the House.” This genre has a long track record and was probably the first tale Man ever told. It has two working parts: A monster. A house. And when you add people into that house, desperate to kill the monster, you’ve got a movie type so primal that it translates to everyone, everywhere. It's the type of movie that I like to say, “You can pitch to a caveman." lt’s not about being dumb, it's about being Primal. And everyone understands the simple, primal commandment: Don't... Get... Eaten!
<br>
<br>That’s why this genre is responsible for so many worldwide hits and franchises. You can probably run most of these films without the soundtrack and still "get it." Jurassic Park; the Nightmare On Elm Street, Friday the 13th, and Scream series; Tremors and its sequels; and every haunted house and ghost story ever told are all examples of this genre. Even films without supernatural elements, like Fatal Attraction (starring Glenn Glose as the “Monster"), fall into this category. And it's clear from such movies as Arachnophobia, Lake Placid, and Deep Blue Sea, if you don’t know the rules of Monster in the House — you fail.
<br>
<br>The rules, to me, are simple. The “house” must be a confined space: a beach town, a spaceship, a futuristic Disneyland with dinosaurs, a family unit. There must be sin committed — usually greed (monetary or carnal) — prompting the creation ofa supernatural monster that comes like an avenging angel to kill those who have committed that sin and spare those who realize what that sin is. The rest is “run and hide." And putting a new twist on both the monster, the monster’s powers, and the way we say “Boo!” is the job of the screenwriter who wants to add to the illustrious limb of this family tree of movies.
<br>
<br>We can see a bad example of this category in Arachnophobia, the film starring Jeff Daniels and John Goodman. Bad monster: a little spider. Not much supernatural there. Not all that scary either — you step on it and it dies. Also: No house! At any given moment, the residents of Arachnophobia can say "Check please" and be on the next Greyhound out of town.
<br>
<br>Where is the tension there?
<br>
<br>Because the filmmakers behind Arachnophobia violated the rules of Monster in the House, they wound up with a mishmash. Is it a comedy or a drama? Are we really supposed to be scared—scared? I could write a whole book on the rules of Monster in the House, but you don't need me to have a MITH film festival in your own home and discover these nuances for yourself. And if you're writing a screenplay that falls into this genre, I suggest you do just that.
<br>
<br>I want to make clear that, as with all the genres to be discussed here, this is a category that has not, repeat not, been exhausted. There is always a way to do a new one. But you must give it a fresh twist to be successful. You must break from cliché. You must "Give us the same thing. .. only different." Anyone who thinks there isn’t new territory to mine in the Monster in the House genre, should think of the myth of the Minotaur. Great Monster: a half-man/half—bull. Great house: a maze where the condemned are sent to die. But the ancient Greek hack who eyed this successful story and said: “It's over. Genre’s dead. I can't top that!” never envisioned Glenn Close with a bad perm and a boiled rabbit.

This one hardly requires an explanation. It’s about being trapped somewhere with a monster, and trying not to die, and trying to understand what summoned the monster. 
<br>
<br>Requirements:
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A monster that is supernatural in its powers, even if its strength derives from insanity and evil at its core.
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A house, meaning an enclosed space. Houses can be family units, entire towns, or even the world.
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sin. Someone is guilty of bringing the monster to the house… a transgression that can include ignorance.

<b>Golden fleece —</b> This is the category of movie best exemplified by Lord of the Rings; The Wizard of Oz; Finding Nemo; and most "heist movies."

<b>THE GOLDEN flEECE</b>
<br>The quest myth has been one of the more winning tales told around the campfire since, well, forever. And if your screenplay can in any way be categorized as a "Road Movie,” then you must know the rules of a genre I call "The Golden fleece.” The name comes from the myth of Jason and the Argonauts and yet it’s always about the same thing: A hero goes “on the road" in search of one thing and winds up discovering something else — himself. Thus Wizard Of Oz; Planes, Train and Automobiles; Star Wars; Road Trip; and Back to the Future are all basically the same movie.
<br>
<br>Scary, huh?
<br>
<br>Like the twists of any story, the milestones of The Golden fleece are the people and incidents that our hero or heroes encounter along the way. Because it’s episodic it seems to not be connected, but it must be. The theme of every Golden fleece movie is internal growth; how the incidents affect the hero is, in fact, the plot. It is the way we know that we are truly making forward progress — it’s not the mileage we’re racking up that makes a good Golden fleece, it’s the way the hero changes as he goes. And forcing those milestones to mean something to the hero is your job.
<br>
<br>As it turns out, I have been working on a Golden fleece with my current writing partner, the amazingly successful and talented Sheldon Bull. And we have been discussing Golden fleece movies a lot — naturally. Since our film is a comedy, we've looked at Planes, Trains and Automobiles, and discussed the character dynamics of Rain Man, Road Trip, and even Animal House, believe it or not, in an effort to get a handle on what is basically the story of a kid who heads home after being unjustly kicked out of military school and discovers... that his parents have moved without telling him. It's basically “Home Alone on the road." (Sorry! It’s a bad habit). The adjustments we are making aren’t about the adventure — which I find hilarious — but about what each incident means to our kid hero. In many ways what these adventures are is irrelevant. Whatever fun set pieces our hero encounters must be shaded to deliver milestones of growth for our kid lead. We always come back to that Golden fleece truism that can be found in The Odyssey, Gulliver's Travels, and any number of successful road stories through the ages: It’s not the incidents, it's what the hero learns about himself from those incidents that makes the story work. This genre is also where all heist movies are found. Any quest, mission, or “treasure locked in a castle" that is to be approached by an individual or a group falls into the Golden fleece category and has the same rules. Very often the mission becomes secondary to other, more personal, discoveries; the twists and turns of the plot are suddenly less important than the meaning derived from the heist, as Ocean's Eleven, The Dirty Dozen, and The Magnificent Seven prove.

Golden fleece stories are about the main character – and often his friends – chasing a clear and definable prize or goal which seems unreachably hard. The story is over when they’ve conclusively either won the prize, or not. It’s all about the quest, and we see how the characters change in response to the hurdles they face. Beware goals or prizes which are unclear or not big or challenging enough, which lead to journeys which are not as compelling as they could be. Think of Frodo going on the journey to Mordor to destroy the One Ring, or Naruto and company trying to rescue Sasuke from Orochimaru. The goal is always foremost in the characters mind – these are true quest stories. And Golden fleeces are NOT simply any story that doesn’t fit into any other category. 
<br>
<br>Requirements:
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A road – spanning oceans, time, or just across the street – so long as it demarcates growth. It often includes a “Road Apple,” the thing that stops the team from gaining the prize. (a setback, surprise backstab, or bit of new information that makes the participants think they will never win the day, e.g., when Tom Hanks and company find Private Ryan — and he refuses to go home.)
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team or a buddy the hero needs to be guided by along the way. Usually, it’s those who represent the things the hero doesn’t have: skill, experience, or attitude.
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prize that’s highly sought after and is something primal: going home, securing a treasure, or re-gaining a birthright.

<b>Out of the Bottle —</b> This incorporates films like Liar, Liar; Bruce Almighty; the Mask; Freaky Friday; flubber; and even my own little kid hit from Disney, Blank Check.

<txt id="fsz13pt"> 
<b>OUT OF THE BOTTLE</b>
<br>"I wish I had my own money!" This is what our character Preston Waters states in the movie Colby Carr and I wrote and sold to Disney that became a kid's mini—hit called Blank Check. And Preston will, in fact, soon get his own money — a million dollars to be exact — with which he will happily run amok. This type of wish-fulfillment is so common because it’s a big part of the human psyche. "I wish I had an" is probably the single most frequently spoken prayer since Adam. And stories that tell a good "what if" tale that exploits these wish fulfillment fantasies are good, primal, easy—for—a—caveman—to—understand stories — which is why
they're so many of them. And why they’re so successful.
<br>
<br>The comedy hit Bruce Almighty is an example of this genre. In fact, the flexible Jim Carrey has also been the star of another "Out of the Bottle" classic, The Mask. It doesn’t have to be God who bestows the magic. It can be a thing — like The Mask or a magic VW named "Herbie" in Disney’s The Love Bug, or a formula that you invent to make the opposite sex fall in love with you as in Love Potion #9 starring Sandra Bullock, or magic silly—putty that can save your teaching career as in flubber starring Robin Williams. The name Out of the Bottle should evoke the image ofa genie who is summoned out of the bottle to grant his master’s wish, but it doesn’t have to be magic to be part of this wish—fulfillment genre. In Blank Check, there is no magic that gets Preston his million bucks — sure it’s a long shot, and Colby and I went out of our way to make it seem reality—based. But it doesn’t matter. Whether it’s by divine intervention or luck or a magic being who enters the scene, it’s the same device. For some reason or other, usually because we like the guy or gal and think they deserve it, their wish is granted and their lives begin to change.
<br>
<br>On the flip side of Out of the Bottle, but very much the same category, is the curse aspect of wishing. These are comeuppance tales. Another Jim Carrey movie, Liar, Liar, is a good example (hmmm, are we seeing a pattern here about what stars consistently fit best into what Jungian archetypes?). Same set—up, same device — a kid wishes his lying lawyer father would start telling nothing but the truth — and lo, it happens. Suddenly Jim Carrey can’t tell a lie — on the day of a big case in which lying is, and has been, his best weapon. Jim’s going to have to change his ways and grow if he is to survive, and by doing so, he gets what he really wants in the first place: the respect of his wife and son. Another comeuppance tale is Freaky Friday, both the Jodie Foster version and the updated Lindsay Lohan take. But there are many of these, such as All Of Me with Steve Martin and Groundhog Day starring another famous wise guy, Bill Murray.
<br>
<br>The rules of Out of the Bottle then are this: If it's a wish—fulfillment tale, the hero must be a put—upon Cinderella who is so under the thumb of those around him that we are really rooting for anyone, or anything, to get him a little happiness. And yet, so the rules tell us and human nature dictates, we don’t want to see anyone, even the most underdog character, succeed for too long. And eventually, the hero must learn that magic isn't everything, it’s better to be just like us —— us members of the audience —— because in the end we know this will never happen to us. Thus a lesson must be in the offing; a good moral must be included at the end. If it’s a comeuppance tale version of Out of the Bottle, then the opposite set—up is applied. Here's a guy or gal who needs a swift kick in the behind. And yet, there must be something redeemable about them. This is a little trickier to pull off and must include a Save the Cat scene at the outset, one where we know that even though this guy or gal is a jerk, there is something in them that’s worth saving. So in the course of the tale, they get the benefit of the magic (even though it’s a curse); and in the end, they triumph.

These are wish fulfillment stories where magic comes into a characters life and in many stories causes a lot of silly situations, as well as causes complications and challenges that never would've been there without it. Usually, it's easier for readers to swallow if the magic emerges from some sort of relatable, semi-explainable place (i.e. not too arbitrary or contrived) like a carnival wish machine, an electrical storm, or some established mythology like genies or witchcraft. And the magic should go away or be resolved in the end, with the character back to an essentially "normal life," where they've grown in some way. Think Aladdin, Bruce Almighty, Liar Liar, etc.
<br>
<br>Requirements:
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wish asked for by the hero or granted by another, and a clear need to be delivered from the ordinary.
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear rules for how the magic works and what its limitations are.
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lesson: ‘Life is good as it is,’ and, ‘be careful what you wish for’ are the running themes in all OOTB’s.

<b>DUDE WITH A PROBLEM</b>
<br>This genre is defined by the phrase: “An ordinary guy finds himself in extraordinary circumstances.” And when you think about it, it’s another of the most popular, most primal situations we can imagine for ourselves. All of us consider ourselves to be an ordinary guy or gal, and thus we are drawn into sympathetic alignment with the hero of this type of tale from the get—go. Into this “just an ordinary day” beginning comes something extraordinary — my wife’s building is taken over by terrorists with ponytails (Die Hard); Nazis start hauling away my Jewish friends (Schindler's List); a robot from the future (with an accent!) comes and tells me he is here to kill me and my unborn child (The Terminator); the ship in which we are traveling hits an iceberg and begins to sink without enough lifeboats for everyone on board (Titanic).
<br>
<br>These, my friends, are problems. Big, primal problems.
<br>
<br>So how are you, the ordinary guy, going to handle them?
<br>
<br>Like Monster in the House, this genre also has two very simple working parts: a dude, meaning an average guy or gal just like ourselves. And a problem; something that this average guy must dig deep inside himself to conquer. From these simple components, an infinite number of mix—and—match situations can bloom and grow. The more average the guy, the bigger the challenge, as movies like Breakdown with Kurt Russell demonstrate.
<br>
<br>In Breakdown , Kurt has no super powers or skills, no police training. Nada. But he shares with Die Hard's Bruce Willis the same domestic agenda all average guys understand: Save the wife that he loves! Whether our hero is skilled or not, it’s the relative size of the challenge that makes these stories work. And one rule of thumb is: The badder the bad guy, the greater the heroics. So make the bad guy as bad as possible — always! - for the bigger the problem, the greater the odds for our dude to overcome. And no matter who the bad guy is, the dude triumphs from his willingness to use his individuality to outsmart the far more powerful forces aligned against him.

These stories are about a normal guy thrust into abnormal circumstances. This particular genre dictates a certain type of problem: one that is life-or-death and immediate, that must be solved through some sort of physical battle, right now. The whole movie is essentially a chronicle of that battle (which might consist of a series of mini-battles). Think Die Hard, Bourne Identity, Misery, 2012, or Apollo 13.
<br>
<br>Requirements:
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An innocent hero who’s dragged into this mess without asking for it — sometimes without even being aware of how he got involved.
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden event that thrusts innocent(s) into a world of hurt and comes without warning.
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A life or death battle for the continued existence of an individual, family, group, or society.

<b>RITES OF PASSAGE</b>
<br>Remember the time you were awkwardly going through puberty and that cute girl you had a crush on didn't know you were alive? Remember that birthday party when you turned 40 and your husband came to you and asked for a divorce? These painful examples of life transition resonate with us because we have all, to a greater or lesser degree, gone through them. And growing—pain stories register because they are the most sensitive times in our lives. It’s what makes us human, and what makes for excellent, poignant, and even hilarious storytelling. (Isn’t Dudley Moore in 10 the funniest mid—life crisis put on film?) But whether it’s drama or comedy, "Rites of Passage” tales are of a type. And all have the same rules.
<br>
<br>All movies are about change, so to say that Rites of Passage stories document a change is missing the point. These are tales of pain and torment, but usually from an outside force: Life. sure it's about the choices we've made, but the “monster” attacking us is often unseen, vague, or one which we can’t get a handle on simply because we can’t name it. Lost Weekend, Days of Wine and Roses, 28 Days starring Sandra Bullock, and When A Man Loves A Woman starring Meg Ryan all tell stories about coming to grips with drugs and alcohol. Likewise, puberty, mid—life crisis, old age, romantic break—up, and “grieving” stories, like those about getting over the death of a loved one, such as Ordinary People, also have the same thing in common: In a good Rites of Passage tale, everybody’s in on “the joke” except the person who’s going through it — the story's hero. And only the experience can offer a solution. In essence, whether the take is comedic or dramatic, the monster sneaks up on the beleaguered hero and the story is that hero's slow realization of who and what that monster is. In the end, these tales are about surrendering, the victory won by giving up to forces stronger than ourselves. The end point is acceptance of our humanity and the moral of the story is always the same: That’s Life! (another Blake Edwards movie! Hmmm, between that, 10, and Days of Wine and Roses, Blake Edwards appears to like and do well in this genre.)
<br>
<br>If your movie idea can in any way be considered a Rites of Passage tale, then these films are fair game for screening. Like the steps of acceptance outlined in Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's On Death and
Dying, the structure of this story type is charted in the hero’s
grudging acceptance of the forces of nature that he cannot control
or comprehend, and the victory comes with the hero's ability to
ultimately smile.

The main character is going through a relatable life problem (like adolescence, divorce, mid-life, loss of a loved one, or addiction), which he’s attempting to avoid by chasing something else. They are clearly on a wrong road, as they spend most of the movie in pursuit of some challenging goal that is entertaining to watch, but not ultimately going to work out well. Finally, they're left having to face life after all, hopefully having learned something in the process. Just because a character is going through some sort of rite of passage (in the generic sense) does not mean it meats the criteria for this genre.
<br>
<br>Requirements:
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common life problem that the audience can understand and sympathize with, which the hero does not quite understand yet.
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wrong way to attack the mystifying problem, usually a diversion from confronting the pain.
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A solution that involves acceptance of a hard truth the hero has been fighting, and the knowledge that it’s the hero that must change, not the world around him.

<b>Buddy Love —</b> This genre is about more than the buddy movie dynamic as seen in cop buddy pictures, Emperor’s New Groove, Toy Story, and Dumb & Dumber — but also every love story ever made!

<b>BUDDY LOVE</b>
<br>The classic "buddy story" is a type that I think of as a creation of the Movie Age. Though there were a few great buddy tales (Don Quixote, for example), this category really didn’t take off as a story form until the dawn of cinema. My theory is that the buddy movie was invented by a screenwriter who realized that his hero had no one to react to. There was just this big, empty space where interior monologue and description is found in fiction. And the screenwriter suddenly thought "what if" his hero had someone to debate important story issues with? Thus the classic “buddy movie" was born, and from Laurel and Hardy to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to the antics of Wane’s World (both 1 & 2), it has become a movie staple. Two guys talking to each other like 48 Hours; two girls talking to each other like Thelma & Louise; two fish talking to each other like Finding Nemo — they all work because stories of "me and my best friend" will always resonate. Again, they’re very human and based on universal circumstances. These are stories you can pitch to a caveman and both he (and his buddy!) will get it.
<br>
<br>The secret of a good buddy movie is that it is actually a love story in disguise. And, likewise, all love stories are just buddy movies with the potential for sex. Bringing Up Baby, Pat and Mike, Woman of the Year, Two Weeks Notice, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days are — genre—wise —just sophisticated Laurel and Hardy movies where one of the buddies is wearing a skirt. And yet the rules for these, drama or comedy, sex or no sex, are the same. At first the “buddies” hate each other. (Where would they have to go if they didn't?) But their adventure together brings out the fact that they need each other; they are, in essence, incomplete halves of a whole. And realizing this leads to even more conflict. Who can tolerate needing anybody? Penultimately, the All Is Lost moment (more on this in Chapter Four) which occurs toward the end of each of these stories is: separation, a fight, a goodbye—and—good—riddance! that is, in reality, none of these. It’s just two people who can’t stand the fact that they don’t live as well without each other, who will have to surrender their egos to win. And when the final curtain comes down, they have done just that.
<br>
<br>Often, as in Rain Man, one of the buddies is the story's hero and will do all or most of the changing (i.e., Tom Cruise) while the other buddy acts as a catalyst of that change and will do slight or no changing (i.e., Dustin Hoffman). I have been in many story discussions about this dynamic. Whose story is it?? is what it very often boils down to. Lethal Weapon is like that to an extent. It’s Danny Glover’s story. Mel Gibson is the agent of change. And though Mel will not be suicidal by the story's end, it’s Danny Glover whose transformation we care most about. These “catalyst” Buddy Love tales, in which a “being” comes into one's life, affects it, and leaves, is a subset of the Buddy Love dynamic and an important one to keep in mind. Many "boy and his dog" tales are like this, including E. T.
<br>
<br>If you’re writing a buddy movie or love story, either drama or comedy, the dynamics of the Buddy Love structure are a must to know. Sit down with a dozen of these, pop ‘em into your DVD player, and get ready to be amazed by how similar they all are. Is this stealing? Is Sandra Bullock ripping off Katherine Hepburn? Should Cary Grant’s estate sue Hugh Grant for copyright infringement? Of course not. It’s just good storytelling. And the beats are the same for a reason. Because they always work.

In “Buddy Love” stories, the main problem of the story is somehow related to a key relationship that seems essential to the main character, which is in jeopardy somehow. In Emperor’s New Groove Kuzco needs Patcha’s help navigating the jungles to get back to the palace to turn back into a human. In Toy Story, the toys think Woody tried to kill Buzz, so Woody needs to save Buzz to proove he’s not a murderer. Without the buddy, achieving the plot goal is impossible. The central question of the movie and the main issue that is explored throughout is "will they or won't they end up together?" Think Talladega Nights, Step Brothers, Toy Story, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Starsky and Hutch, etc.

<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An “incomplete hero” who is missing something physical, ethical, or spiritual; he needs someone else to make him whole.
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or more counterparts who have the qualities the hero needs.
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big problem which the hero and his buddy must solve together and which must cause the hero and buddy to fight, split apart, and ultimately come together over.

<b>WHYDUNIT</b>
<br>We all know that evil lurks in the hearts of men. Greed happens. Murder happens. And unseen evildoers are responsible for it all. But the "who" is never as interesting as the “why.” Unlike the Golden fleece, a good Whydunit isn’t about the hero changing, it’s about the audience discovering something about human nature they did not think was possible before the "crime" was committed and the “case” began. Like Citizen Kane, a classic Whydunit, the story is about seeking the innermost chamber of the human heart and discovering something unexpected, something dark and often unattractive, and the answer to the question: Why?
<br>
<br>Chinatown is perhaps the best Whydunit ever made, and a textbook example of great screenwriting. It's one of those movies that you can see a thousand times and drive deeper into smaller and smaller rooms of the Nautilus shell with each viewing. What makes it a great Whydunit is what makes all classic Whydunits work. From China Syndrome to All the President's Men to JFK to Mystic River, every detective story or social drama, these stories walk on the dark side. They take us to the shadowy part of the street. And the rules are simple. We in the audience are the detectives, ultimately. While we have a surrogate or surrogates onscreen doing the work for us, it’s we who must ultimately sift through the information, and we who must be shocked by what we find.
<br>
<br>If your movie is about this type of discovery, take a look at the great Whydunits. Note how a surrogate onscreen represents us. And see why the investigation into the dark side of humanity is often an investigation into ourselves in an M.C. Escher—kaleidoscopic—reptile—eating—its—own—tail kinda way. That’s what a good Whydunit does — it turns the x—ray machine back on ourselves and
asks: "Are we this evil?”

These are detective stories where the perpetrator of some dark deed is a seemingly innocent person, like a six year old girl who kills and eats her family. In these stories, we often see a case within a case – usually an initial or long-buried caper that for some reason is unresolved, but by pursuing another case, the detective revisits the original — and cracks both. First there are red herrings, but we follow a series of clues leading to a final secret, and we eventually learn who did it, and we learn why they did it – and the why is far more interesting than the who. 
<br>
<br>Requirements:
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detective, the main character. He can be any kind of gumshoe — from pro to amateur to imaginary.
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the question: “Whydunit?” Obviously the more compelling this answer is – which the whole story is building up to – the better the story. We must know! And so must the hero.
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “dark turn.” In pursuit of the secret, the detective will break all the rules, even his own – even the one’s he’s relied on for years and promised himself he’d never break. The pull of the secret is too great.

<b>THE FOOL TRIUMPHANT</b>
<br>The "Fool" is an important character in myth and legend and has been forever. On the outside, he’s just the Village Idiot, but further examination reveals him to be the wisest among us. Being such an underdog gives the Fool the advantage of anonymity, and also makes everyone underestimate his ability, allowing him or her the chance to ultimately shine.
<br>
<br>The Fool in the movies goes back to Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd. Little men, silly men, overlooked men, who triumph by luck and pluck and the specialness that comes from not giving up despite the odds. In modern movies, Dave, Being There, Amadeus, Forrest Gump, and many of the movies of Steve Martin, Bill Murray, and Ben Stiller come to mind as examples of how this tradition has evolved and why it will always have a place.
<br>
<br>The operating principal of "The Fool Triumphant" is to set the underdog Fool against a bigger, more powerful, and often "establishment" bad guy. Watching a so—called "idiot" get the goat of those society deems to be the winners in life gives us all hope, and pokes fun at the structures we take so seriously in our day—to-day lives. Thus, no establishment is too sacred to be skewered, from the White House (Dave) to success in the business world (The Jerk) to the overblown reverence for the importance of our culture (Forrest Gump).
<br>
<br>The working parts of a Fool Triumphant movie are simple: an underdog — who is seemingly so inept and so unequipped for life that everyone around him discounts his odds for success (and does so repeatedly in the set—up) — and an institution for that underdog to attack. Often, the Fool has an accomplice, an “insider” who is in on the joke and can’t believe the Fool is getting away with his “ruse”: Salieri in Amadeus, the Doctor in Being There, Lieutenant Dan in Forrest Gump. These characters often get the brunt of the slapstick, the guy at the end of the Rube Goldberg chain of events the Fool sets into motion, who ultimately gets the pie in the face, like Herbert Lom in The Pink Panther. Their crime is being close to the idiot, seeing him for what he really is, and being stupid enough to try to interfere.
<br>
<br>Special Fools, whether they're in comedies or dramas like Charley and Awakenings, offer us a glimpse of the life of the outsider. We all feel like that at times, and tales of the Fool Triumphant give us the vicarious thrill of victory.

<b>INSTITUTIONALIZED</b>
<br>Where would we be without each other? And when we band together as a group with a common cause, we reveal the ups and clowns of sacrificing the goals of the few for those of the many. Thus, the genre I call "Institutionalized" tells stories about groups, institutions, and “families.” These stories are special because they both honor the institution and expose the problems of losing one’s identity to it.
<br>
<br>One flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest is about a group of mental patients. American Beauty is about a group of modern suburbanites. M*A*S*H is about the American military. The Godfather is about a Mafia family. Each has a breakout character whose role is to expose the group goal as a fraud. Jack Nicholson, Kevin Spacey, Donald Sutherland, and Al Pacino, respectively, carry this role in these films.
<br>
<br>The reason I've clubbed these stories Institutionalized is that the group dynamic these tales tell is often crazy and even self-destructive. “Suicide Is Painless,” the theme song of M*A*S*H, isn't so much about the insanity of war as the insanity of the herd mentality. When we put on a uniform, be it the uniform of the Army or a comfortable cotton shirt with a little polo player over the pocket, we give up who we are to a certain extent. And these movies are all about the pros and cons of putting the group ahead of ourselves. Again, this is a very "caveman" kind of story. Loyalty to the group sometimes flies in the face of common sense, even survival, but we do it. And we have done it forever. To watch others fight that battle, just like we do every day, is why this genre is so popular... and so primal.
<br>
<br>Often movies of the Institutionalized category will be told from the point of view of a newcomer. He is us — a virgin who is new to this group and who is being brought into it by someone who is more experienced. Jane Fonda in 9 to 5 and Tom Hulce in Animal House are examples. For any world in which the technology, lingo, or rules are not familiar to the average viewer, these characters can be invaluable relayers of exposition. They can literally ask “How does that work?” and allow you to explain the importance to everybody. It’s a way to show what is often a “crazy” world to us civilians. Ultimately, all the stories in this category come down to a question: Who’s crazier, me or them? All one need do to understand how sacrificing oneself for the group can be an insane proposition is to check out Al Pacino’s face at the end of Godfather 2. Here is a guy who has committed suicide for the good of the family and “tradition.” And look where it got him. It is just as shocking as Kevin Spacey's last—minute discovery in American Beauty and mirrors, almost exactly, Jack Nicholson’s blank post—operative expression in Cuckoo’s Nest. Why? Because it’s the same movie, with the same message, told in extremely different and moving ways. But they all work for a reason.
<br>
<br>Because each movie followed the rules.
<br>
<br>And they gave us the same thing. .. only different.

Like Gulliver tied to the beach by the Lilliputians, a Superhero tale asks us to lend human qualities, and our sympathy, to a super being, and identify with what it must be like to have to deal with the likes of us little people. No wonder so many brainy geeks and teens read comic books! They don’t have far to go to get in sync and identify with what it’s like to be so misunderstood.
<br>
<br>This genre goes beyond stories about guys in capes and tights, however. It is more than the Marvel universe or the DC Comics
characters. Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind (both Russell Crowe vehicles — another hmmm, interesting) are good examples of human superheroes that are challenged by the mediocre world around them. In both those films, it is the tiny minds that surround the hero that are the real problem. Don’t they get it? Well, no they don’t. That’s why being “special” is so difficult. Frankenstein, Dracula, and X—Men are the same in this regard. Ultimately, all superhero tales are about being “different,” a feeling with which even we Lilliputians can identify. Born into a world he did not create, the Superhero must deal with those who are jealous of his unique point of view and superior mind. And from time to time we all feel this way. Anybody who's ever been shot down at the PTA or sneered at for bold thinking in a meeting at work can identify with Frankenstein's monster being chased by an angry mob of mouth—breathers with pitchforks and torches.
<br>
<br>The problem of how to have sympathy for the likes of millionaire Bruce Wayne or genius Russell Crowe, is solved by stressing the pain that goes hand-in-hand with having these advantages. It's not easy being Bruce Wayne. The poor guy is tortured! And while it might be cheaper to get therapy (if he can afford a Bat—utility belt, he can certainly pay 150 bucks an hour for a shrink), Bruce Wayne is admirable because he eschews his personal comfort in the effort to give back to the community. This is so often why the first movie in a Superhero series succeeds and ones that follow don’t (such as Robocop 2). The creation myth that begins each Superhero franchise stresses sympathy for the Superhero’s plight. Once established, filmmakers forget to re-create that sympathy and draw us into the human side of the Superhero again. (Sp1der—Man 2 avoids this mistake and, not surprisingly, was a smash hit.)
<br>
<br>In truth, we will never truly understand the Superhero. Indeed our identification with him must come from sympathy for the plight of being misunderstood. If you are writing a Superhero movie, a wide range of tales are available for dissection. It’s a long—standing story type for a reason; it gives flight to our greatest fantasies about our potential, while tempering those fantasies with a dose of reality.

Superhero stories are obviously stories featuring people with superhuman abillities. The key here is a nemesis and problem that is seemingly bigger than they are. For example, in Rick and Morty, Rick is a god level being, but even he is challenged by the overwhelming smallness and lameness of Jerry, Morty, Summer, even Beth, and Society in general. Good superhero stories, like any stories, are about characters being pressed to their limits and beyond from start to finish, about dealing with big problems that only get worse when you try to deal with them. As a writer it’s important to make sure the problem is compelling enough, hard enough, complicated enough to take a book or movie to solve – and that’s nowhere more true than in superhero stories.
<br>
<br>Requirements:
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero of your tale must have a special “power” of some kind.
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero must be opposed by a “Nemesis” of equal or greater force, who is the “self-made” version of the hero.
<br>○&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a “curse” for the hero that he either surmounts or succumbs to as the price for who he is.

<a href="#!" id="Thinggears-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('Thinggears');return false;"><b>O</b></a>
<div id="Thinggears" class="more"> <blockquote>
I’ve been wondering what these story beats really are in their essence. I started with the hypothesis that they’re all either emotional gears: devices which exist to alternate or enhance the audience’s emotions, or plot gears: devices which have to exist to make the story work, or which spin the story in a different direction - or that a gear can be both emotional and plot based at the same time. I still think my hypothesis is true. But that wasn’t deep enough to satisfy me, so I began looking at each beat up close and trying to figure out what purpose they each really serve.
<br>
<br>And before I show you my conclusions, a final, potent realization: In addition to being plot gears and emotional gears, perhaps most importantly, the beats are initiations. They’re hoops we jump through so that we can say, “Boy, we sure did jump through a lot of hoops!” They make us feel invested in the story. We’ve come so far that we want to see things through to the end. This is no different than in the Mystery Method where Mystery talks about investment in relationships. The longer two people stay in a relationship with each other, the more they believe they’re meant to be together, and the more they want to stay together. After spending so much time together, they believe in the relationship, just as readers <i>believe</i> in the story, not that it’s real, but that it will be worth reading on to the end. In real life, people in relationships actually feel invested for precisely the same reason that people reading a fictional story in a book feel invested: because the story has passed through so many beats. Beats make us feel <i>invested</i>.
<br>------
<br>This is what I came up with:
<br>
<br><b>01. Opening Image:</b> is not immediately emotional, but it helps us see the entire story as beautiful. Uses vague or opaque and striking imagery, something like a poem.
<br><b>02. Theme Stated:</b> is not emotional right now, but it allows us to explore the theme over the course of the story, which is emotional.
<br><b>03. Set-up:</b> is not emotional yet. The six things which need fixing may make us feel something later in the story when they're fixed. We may feel foreboding anticipating the storm we know is brewing. Definitely necessary as a plot gear.
<br><b>04. Catalyst:</b> can be emotional, but doesn't have to be. Necessary as a plot gear.
<br><b>05. Debate:</b> probably primarily emotional. Not really helpful to the plot at all.
<br><b>06. Break into Two:</b> both an emotional and plot gear.
<br><b>07. B Story:</b> can be immediately emotional, but doesn't have to be. but it helps us explore the theme, which is emotional eventually.
<br><b>08. Fun and Games:</b> emotional, literally it's a break from the plot.
<br><b>09. Midpoint:</b> emotional and plot as stakes are raised.
<br><b>10. Bad Guys Close In:</b> definitely emotional, possibly plot too.
<br><b>11. All Is Lost:</b> plot and emotional
<br><b>12. Dark Night of the Soul:</b> plot and emotional
<br><b>13. Break into Three:</b> plot and emotional
<br><b>14. Finale:</b> plot and emotional
<br><b>15. Final Image:</b> emotional

<div id="ThingWhat1" class="more"> <blockquote>
The very first impression of what a movie is — its tone, its mood, the type and scope of the film — are all found in the opening image. I can think of many great ones: the reckless motorcycle ride through the English countryside leading to the death of Lawrence Of Arabia; the gated, looming castle behind which lurks the mysterious Citizen Kane; and even silly ones like the opening image of Animal House — who could forget the motto of Faber College: "Knowledge is good" beneath the statue of the Faber College founder? Don't we know what we're in for with all three of these examples? Don’t each of these opening images set the tone, type, style, and stakes of the movie as a whole?
<br>
<br>The opening image is also an opportunity to give us the starting point of the hero. It gives us a moment to see a “before” snapshot of the guy or gal or group of people we are about to follow on this adventure we’re all going to take. Presumably, if the screenwriter has done his job, there will also be an “after” snapshot to show how things have changed. Like many of the beats on the BS2, the opening image has a matching beat: the final image. These are bookends. And because a good screenplay is about change, these two scenes are a way to make clear how that change takes place in your movie. The opening and final images should be opposites, a plus and a minus, showing change so dramatic it documents the emotional upheaval that the movie represents. Often actors will only read the first and last 10 pages of a script to see if that drastic change is in there, and see if it’s intriguing. If you don't show that change, the script is often tossed across the room into the “Reject” pile.
<br>
<br>So the opening image does a lot. It sets the tone, mood, and style of the movie, and very often introduces the main character and shows us a "before" snapshot of him or her. But mostly what it does is get us to scrunch down in our seats in the movie theater and say: "This is gonna be good!" And since you’ve just screened a dozen movies like the one you’re about to write, you can think of at least six that have standout opening images. All good movies have them.

<br>
It's hard to describe the exact requirements for an opening image, because it's really more art than science. It should be something that feels right to you. And it should relate to the final image somehow (often as it's opposite). A good story is like a poem, and the opening and closing imagery of the story has the potential to help it to be more than merely a chronicle of events, but instead something which is beautiful, which genuinely touches our hearts and forces us to feel something - a thing of art. Go with what feels right to you.

<div id="ThingWhat2" class="more"> <blockquote>
Somewhere in the first five minutes of a well—structured screenplay, someone (usually not the main character) will pose a question or make a statement (usually to the main character) that is the theme of the movie. “Be careful what you wish for," this person will say or “Pride goeth before a fall" or “Family is more important than money." It won't be this obvious, it will be conversational, an offhand remark that the main character doesn’t quite get at the moment — but which will have far—reaching and meaningful impact later.
<br>
<br>This statement is the movie’s thematic premise. In many ways a good screenplay is an argument posed by the screenwriter, the pros and cons of living a particular kind of life, or pursuing a particular goal. Is a behavior, dream, or goal worth it? Or is it false? What is more important, wealth or happiness? "He who has the gold makes the rules!" Preston's lunkhead brother tells him, and that's the Theme Stated in the first five minutes of Blank Check. Is the statement true? That's what the movie will debate.
<br>
<br>Who is greater in the overall scheme of things — the individual or the group? And the rest of the screenplay is the argument laid out, either proving or clisproving this statement, and looking at it, pro and con, from every angle. Whether you’re writing a comedy, a drama, or a sci—fi monster picture, a good movie has to be "about something." And the place to stick what your movie is about is right up front. Say it! Out loud. Right there.
<br>
<br>If you don’t have a movie that’s about something, you’re in trouble. Strive to figure out what it is you’re trying to say. Maybe you won’t know until your first draft is done. But once you do know, be certain that the subject is raised right up front — page 5 is where I always put it.
<br>
<br>But make sure it’s there. It’s your opening bid.
<br>
<br>Declare; I can prove it. Then set out to do so.

This is where we put forward some kind of idea which our story will eventually show to be true, or show to be false. Usually the premise comes through some offhand remark or question spoken by someone other than the main character. The theme stated beat is the question (even if it's not delivered in the form of a question), and the whole story, the heart of which is the theme, is the answer. Answering this one question is what the entire story is truly about.

<div id="ThingWhat3" class="more"> <blockquote>
The first 10 pages of the script, or first dozen pages at most, is called the "set—up." If you’re like me, and like most readers in Hollywood, this is the make-or—break section where you have to grab me or risk losing my interest. Think of all the good set—ups you've seen in the first reel — the first ten minutes — which “sets up" the hero, the stakes, and goal of the story... and does so with vigor!
<br>
<br>The set—up is also the place where, if you’re me the writer, I make sure I've introduced or hinted at introducing every character in the A story. Watch any good movie and see. Within the first 10 minutes you meet or reference them all. Make sure by your page 10 you have done the same.
<br>
<br>The first 10 pages is also where we start to plant every character tic, exhibit every behavior that needs to be addressed later on, and show how and why the hero will need to change in order to win. She’s an isolated writer who lives in a make—believe world (Romancing the Stone); he's a hip, slick, and sawy foreign car importer who’s as glib as he is cold (Rain Man); she’s a ditzy airhead who doesn't appear to have much substance (Legaly Blonde). And when there’s something that our hero wants or is lacking, this is the place to stick the Six Things That Need Fixing. This is my phrase, six is an arbitrary number, that stands for the laundry list you must show — repeat SHOW — the audience of what is missing in the hero’s life. Like little time bombs, these Six Things That Need Fixing, these character tics and flaws, will be exploded later in the script, turned on their heads and cured. They will become running gags and call—backs. We, the audience, must know why they’re being called back! Look at Big and its primary set—up "You have to be this tall to go on this ride." On the list of Six Things That Need Fixing there are other needs besides a height requirement. The kid in Big can’t get the girl, have any privacy. etc. But in Act Two he gets all those things when he magically turns Big. And those call—backs only work because we have seen them in the set—up.
<br>
<br>Jeez, but that’s a lot of stuff to do in the first 10 pages! But there it is. If you want to play with the Big boys, these are the tasks you must accomplish.
<br>
<br>One last word on the set—up as it relates to Act One. I like to think of movies as divided into three separate worlds. Most people call these three acts, I call ‘em thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. The first 10 pages and the rest of Act One is the movie’s thesis; it’s where we see the world as it is before the adventure starts. It is a full-fledged documentation of the hero’s world labeled “before.” There is a calm before the storm in this world, and especially in the set—up. If events that follow did not occur, it would pretty much stay this way. But there is a sense in the set—up that a storm’s about to hit, because for things to stay as they are... is death.
<br>
<br>Things must change.

While the opening image and theme stated beats were poetic, the set-up is more nuts and bolts. You have various tasks to accomplish here. For one, the audience is still deciding whether to commit to listening to your entire story or whether to walk away, and you need to grab their interest and make them decide to stay. You also need to introduce or hint at every character in the A story. And you need to plant the six things that need fixing for the hero(es). This is also probably a good place to put a “save the cat” scene. All of act one, including the setup, makes up the “thesis” part of the story, where we see the world as it is before the adventure starts – the calm before the storm. But there should be a sense even in the setup that a storm is going to hit. One good way to show normal life is to show the hero at work, at home, and at play. The Setup does not necessarily tell us yet who the hero is in the story, what the stakes are going to be, or what the story goal will be. It basically shows us life as usual, everything that happens before the catalyst comes along and diverts life down an unexpected path. The story hasn't really even started yet, and won't until the catalyst. But just because we're showing life as usual doesn't mean things should be boring. To be interesting, we still need conflicts, it's just that at this point they're mundane ones, or one's which are incidental, not a major part in the overall story. For example, in Scream the set-up showed us a girl being taunted by a killer over the phone. I was very confused as to how that could qualify as being a set-up. For the girl, it was not life as usual at all. But that’s okay, because this is not her story, this story isn't about her. And the real world does have demented killers in it – even if most people don't think about that – and that means that believe it or not, aware of it or not, this is normal life. More importantly, those things did set the stage for what was to come in the story, they gave us information we needed to see in order to make the story richer. And it was a vigorous way to cement our decision to watch rather than change the channel. So, without a doubt, it was set-up. I think set-up is kind of a default beat for act 1 in that when we're not in any particular other beat, we can assume that we've gone back to do more work setting up the story. We can hop from some set-up into the theme stated, for example, and then go back and continue with set-up. It makes sense, as there's a lot to do here. As Snyder says, it's a full-fledged documentation of the hero’s world labeled “before.”

<TXT style="color:black;">
<br><b>THE STASIS = DEATH BEAT:</b>
<BR>One story element that doesn't appear on the Beat Sheet is called Stasis = Death, which can be found between Set-Up and Catalyst and is part of a larger conversation about "change." Stasis means "things staying the same." Death means "death." And it's the point in the story where we reveal that this hero's life isn't all it's cracked up to be - and may stay that way. After we've figured out the Set-Up and introduced all the cahracters in the A Story in the first 10 pages - or 10 minutes - of a movie, there is often this "sigh moment" for the hero, where we see that if things "stay the same," our poor protag is doomed.</txt>

The package that arrives in Romancing the Stone which will send Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) to South America; the telephone call that informs Tom Cruise his father has died in Rain Man; the dinner at which Reese Witherspoon’s fiancé announces he’s clumping her in Legally Blonde —— these are the catalyst moments: telegrams, getting fired, catching the wife in bed with another man, news that you have three days to live, the knock at the door, the messenger. In the setup you, the screenwriter, have told us what the world is like and now in the catalyst moment you knock it all down. Boom! I frankly love the catalyst moment, and I really miss it when I don’t see it done, or done well. Have to have it. Like my pet peeve — the lack of decent Save the Cat scenes in hip, slick movies — this is another one that bugs me when it’s not there. I like the catalyst moment because — it’s life. Those moments happen to all of us. And life—changing events often come disguised as bad news. Like many of the beats in the BS2, the catalyst is not what it seems. It's the opposite of good news, and yet, by the time the adventure is over, it’s what leads the hero to happiness.
<br>
<br>When I’m writing a screenplay, my catalyst moment will float around for the first couple of drafts. The set—up will be too long, the story is clogged with details, and that page 12 catalyst beat is somehow, mysteriously, on page 20. Well, cut it down and put it where it belongs: page 12. And when you start trimming all your darlings away, you'll suddenly realize that's why we have these little structure maps — all that boring detail was redundant or you weren’t very good about showing it economically. The catalyst point is the first moment when something happens! Thank God! And if it’s not there, the reader will get antsy. Your coverage will read: "No Plot" because you’ll have lost the reader’s attention. Page 12 — Catalyst. Do it.

In the Catalyst, something happens which sets the hero on the path of the adventure. Generally we can think of the Opening Image and the Set-Up as being before the story really starts – they show us life as usual – and the Catalyst is the first moment when something different actually happens, and it knocks down the expectations laid by normal life and diverts the path of the hero onto the adventure. Catalysts are often, but not always, something bad that happens. In stories as in the real world, life changing events often come disguised as bad news. But the catalyst of a story, if it’s apparently something bad, is usually, in the end, not really what it seems. It's seems to be the opposite of good news, and yet, by the time the adventure is over, it’s what leads the hero to happiness, probably, unless you don’t have a happy ending.
<br>
<br>
<txt style=color:black;">
Note that sometimes for a Catalyst we get what's called a <b>Double Bump</b>. It doesn't happen in every story, but often two Catalysts are required to kick a stubborn tale into motion. In Star Wars, it's not enough for Luke to be summoned by a Princess; he'll need one more push that comes when he finds his aunt and uncle dead. It's the second "bump" at the end of Act One that kicks him into Two.</txt>

This is a section of the script, between pages 12 and 25, that used to really baffle me. When the telegram comes on page 12 informing me that my sister is being held by pirates, I know what I have to do! So why do I, the writer, have to vamp to the Act Break until my hero does what he’s supposed to?
<br>
<br>The debate section is just that — a debate. It's the last chance for the hero to say: This is crazy. And we need him or her to realize that. Should I go? Dare I go? Sure, it’s dangerous out there, but what’s my choice? Stay here?
<br>
<br>My writing partner Sheldon Bull and I have been working on our Golden fleece movie. In Act One, a kid is kicked out of military school and sent home to find... his parents have moved. Well, the kid’s stuck. He can't go back to military school and he can't stay where he is. He knows where his parents moved to, so now it's a decision: Should he go on the road to find them? This is our chance to show how daunting a feat this is going to be. Can you imagine? But since it’s a comedy, we've also made it funny. Our kid hero is taken to the edge of town at the end of Act One by a friendly cabbie. The kid looks ahead to a spooky—looking road down which he knows he must travel if he is to find his folks. Gulp. But his fear is quickly made light of when he’s heckled by a driver passing by. And so, on a fun note, and making a firm decision, off he goes.
<br>
<br>Your moment of truth may not be so clear—cut, but it’s important to remember that the debate section must ask a question of some kind. In Legally Blonde the catalyst of the fiance dumping Elle Woods quickly segues to her solution: Go to Harvard Law. "But can she get in?” That is the question posed in the debate section of that movie. The debate section thus becomes showing how Elle answers that question. And when she manages to zoom her LSATs, create a lascivious admissions video, and get accepted, the answer to the question is clear: Yes! And like the kid hero in our “Home Alone on the road" movie, Elle can happily march into Act Two. She has answered the debate question and can now proceed.

In the debate section, someone, often the hero, says, “This is crazy! Are we really going to do this?” The hero (or someone) doubts the journey he must take. Why is that important? Because it’s a hypnotic suggestion. We want the audience to be fully aware of the danger. The more they are, the more they’ll believe in it, the more they’ll respond to it, the more power it’ll hold over their emotions, the more dramatic the story will feel, the more they’ll be sucked into the story. Saying “this is crazy” imparts a sense of realism. Bravery is cheap when there’s nothing to fear. Winning is meaningless when there’s no chance of losing. As they say, “No guts, no glory.” So we have to crank up the emotions by highlighting exactly what there is to fear, and exactly what it is the characters have to lose. Of course, depending on the story and the characters, sometimes the hero won’t doubt what he has to do, or his abillity to do it. Or maybe he will doubt his abillity to succeed, but he’s determined to try, even if failure means death. In a case like that, it’s helpful to have some other character doubt him and debate him. A good example of this is the debate in Ocean’s Eleven where two con artists are talking to the rich Jewish guy. They’re already convinced of what they have to do, but he’s not. First we hear all the reasons why it can't be done, but then, finally, we're won over. It’s important to remember that the debate section must ask a question of some kind. Can your hero really accomplish that goal? Is it even possible? We don’t know yet. But we’re going to find out.

<div id="ThingWhat6" class="more"> <blockquote>
It happens on page 25. I have been in many arguments. Why not page 28? What’s wrong with 30? Don’t. Please. In a 110 page screenplay, it happens no later than 25. Page 25 is the place where I always go to first in a screenplay some- one has handed me (we all have our reading quirks) to see "what happens on 25." I want to know 1) if anything happens and 2) if this screenwriter knows that something should happen. And I mean something big.
<br>
<br>Because that’s what is supposed to happen... on 25. As discussed above, the act break is the moment where we leave the old world, the thesis statement, behind and proceed into a world that is the upside down version of that, its antithesis. But because these two worlds are so distinct, the act of actually stepping into Act Two must be definite.
<br>
<br>Very often when I am writing a screenplay, my act break will start off vaguely. I’ll find that events will draw the hero into Act Two. This is incorrect. The hero cannot be lured, tricked, or drift into Act Two. The hero must make the decision himself. That’s what makes him a hero anyway — being proactive. Take Star Wars. The event that prompts Luke Skywalker on his journey is his parents being killed, but the decision to “go on the road” is his. Luke cannot wake up on Han Solo’s starship wondering how he got there, he has to choose to go. Make sure your hero does likewise.

What defines a Break into Two is that the hero is leaving the normal “thesis” world, and is entering the upside down world of the “antithesis.” There’s always some kind of daunting obstacle here that the hero has to face, and if you’re listening to a story, that daunting obstacle is the landmark that will alert you that you’ve reached the Break into Two. The best way to do it is for the hero to make a deliberate choice to face that obstacle, since being proactive is what makes someone a hero. But in a lot of modern stories, the hero doesn’t make a deliberate choice like that – and that makes for a weak hero character. Still, whether the character is weak or strong, as long as he’s suddenly in the upside down world where everything is different than usual, as long as he’s suddenly facing some big daunting obstacle, he has broken into two. And then the journey begins. In Ocean’s Eleven, the break into two is the moment when all the crooks are gathered in a house together, they’re learning about the big daunting obstacle of all the casino security systems, and each one is about to decide whether they’re in for the job or if they’re out. They decide they’re in, and the story continues. An obstacle and a choice to embrace the new, “antithesis” normal, and then we move on.

<a href="#!" id="ThingWhat7-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('ThingWhat7');return false;"><b>O</b></a>
<div id="ThingWhat7" class="more"> <blockquote>
The B story begins on page 30. And the B story of most screenplays is "the love story.” It is also the story that carries the theme of the movie. I also think that the start of the B story, what takes place around page 30, is a little booster rocket that helps smooth over the shockingly obvious A story act break. Think about it. You’ve set up the A story, you’ve put it into motion, now we’ve had this abrupt jump into Act Two and you’ve landed in a whole new world. The B story says: "Enough already, how about talking about something else!” Which is why the cutaway is usually in line with the A story... but new in scope.
<br>
<br>The B story gives us a breather.
<br>
<br>Let’s take Legally Blonde, for instance. The B story is Elle’s relationship with the manicurist she meets in Boston. And it is a much needed break from the A story. We’ve met Elle. She’s been dumped. She’s decided to go to Law School. She gets there. And school is tough. Well, enough already, let's have a little time—out Let's go slightly off theme here and meet someone new. Thus, the manicurist. And yes, while it is not a traditional hot—girl love story, it is in fact "the love story.” lt’s where Elle will be nurtured. It is also the place where Elle confides what she is learning in the School of Hard Knocks shels experiencing at Harvard Law — and the place from which she'll draw the strength she needs for the final push into Act Three and ultimate victory.
<br>
<br>The B story is also very often a brand new bunch of characters. We have not always met the B story players in the first 10 pages of the screenplay. We did not even know they existed. But since Act Two is the antithesis, they are the upside down versions of those characters who inhabit the world of Act One. Again, the B story ally in Legally Blonde is a perfect example. Isn't Jennifer Coolidge, the wonderful actress who portrays manicurist Paulette Bonafonté, the funhouse mirror version of the girls from Elle’s sorority house back at UCLA? This is why the character is so successful. She is a classic anti—thesis creature.
<br>
<br>The B story then does a lot. And you must have one. It provides not only the love story and a place to openly discuss the theme of your movie, but gives the writer the vital "cutaways” from the A story. And it starts on 30.

The human attention span only goes so far. We’ve done a lot of work setting up the A story, and at this point we need a little break from it. That’s why we have the B story. Traditionally this is the love story, but it doesn’t have to be. It just has to be something different. It’s also the story that carries the theme of the movie. We often meet a brand new bunch of characters that we didn’t even know existed. Since act two is the antithesis, the characters we meet are upside down versions of the characters who inhabit the world of Act One. Periodically, the A story will take little breaks so we can follow the B story some more. A good guideline is, just switch from one to the other whenever it feels right (especially to punctuate very poignant moments).

The fun and games section is that part of the screenplay that, I like to say, provides: The promise of the premise. It is the core and essence of the movie’s poster. It is where most of the trailer moments of a movie are found. And it's where we aren't as concerned with the forward progress of the story —— the stakes won’t be raised until the midpoint — as we are concerned with having “fun.” The fun and games section answers the question: Why did I come to see this movie? What about this premise, this poster, this movie idea, is cool? When you, the development exec, ask for “more set pieces,” this is where I put them. In the fun and games.
<br>
<br>This, to me, is the heart of the movie. When l discovered what this section of the screenplay needs to do, and why it’s there, it leapfrogged me ahead 10 places. For me it happened in the summer of 1989. And it was a definite "huzzah" moment that is rarely so clear. When I was writing my very first draft of Stop or My Mom Will Shoot! I was sort of stuck. I had this great premise, which was: "Dirty Harry gets a new partner — his mother.” But what was that? What was that movie about? What were the dynamics of the comedy? (Many of you I’m sure are still asking.) Then one day I was sitting up in my office in the Fithian Building in Santa Barbara, California, and I had a great idea: the world’s slowest chase! What if Joe the cop and his Mom are shot at by bad guys? And what if they give chase. But what if, instead of Joe jumping behind the wheel and driving — his Mom does. And she drives like a Mom, complete with holding her arm across Joe’s chest when they stop at all the stop signs. When I sold my script and went to my first meeting at Universal, the executive told me that when he read that scene, that's when he decided to buy my script. Why? Because that's when he knew there was something to this idea. I had delivered on the promise of the premise. And where did I put that great set piece? Right where it belonged — in the fun and games section of the screenplay.
<br>
<br>This goes for drama as well. The fun and games in Die Hard show Bruce Willis first outwitting the terrorists. The fun and games in Phone Booth occur when Colin Farrell realizes the seriousness of his predicament. We take a break from the stakes of the story and see what the idea is about; we see the promise of the premise and need not see anything else. I also call it fun and games because this section is lighter in tone than other sections. So Jim Carrey gets to walk around and act like God in Bruce Almighty. And Tobey Maguire gets to try out his oddly onanistic super powers in Spider—Man. It’s also where the buddies in all buddy movies do their most clashing. Get it?
<br>
<br>Fun and games.
<br>
<br>Learn it, love it, live it.

This is the heart of the story. The fun and games section is the part of the story that provides the promise of the premise – the basic concept of the story. Over many scenes, this section answers the question: Why did I choose to sit and listen to this story? What is it about the basic idea of the story that’s cool? “Fun” means whatever we thought was cool about the basic idea. That’s what we explore here. In Bruce Almighty for example, this is where Jim Carrey gets to walk around and play with his new powers. For now, we aren't really concerned with the forward progress of the story, we just want to have fun. We wont get serious again about trying to solve the story question (which is something like, “Can Harry beat Voldemort?”) and trying to advance the plot, until the midpoint. The stakes won’t be raised until the midpoint, so until then, we get to enjoy the cream filling of the story, we get to explore the basic idea. We call it “fun and games,” but it should be understood that this section is not neccesarily happy – but it is less serious. If the premise of the story is very dark, then our “fun” is exploring that darkness. For example, in a horror movie, the fun and games might show many close calls with the monster, and many people dying. But the people who die in this section will be people who aren’t that important to the plot, and the close calls, while scary in the moment, are ultimately not consequential. We don’t disturb the plot we’ve carefully laid out. That’s important to remember. This section is less serious than other sections because it doesn’t change the plot. We get many scenes that showcase and explore the cool premise of the story, and later, we will pick up the plot again and continue moving it forward. In the same way that set-up was the default beat for act one, fun and games, along with the b story, is the default for act two. And when we need to make the story longer, this is generally the first place we go to insert new scenes.

<div id="ThingWhat9" class="more"> <blockquote>
There are two halves in a movie script and the midpoint on page 55 is the threshold between them. We can talk about the importance of the two act breaks, but to me the midpoint is as important, especially in the early going of laying out a script’s beats. I have found, in reviewing hundreds of movies, that a movie's midpoint is either an “up” where the hero seemingly peaks (though it is a false peak) or a "down" when the world collapses all around the hero (though it is a false collapse), and it can only get better from here on out. When you decide which midpoint your script is going to require, it’s like nailing a spike into a wall good and hard. The clothesline that is your story can now be strung securely. I made the discovery of how important this midpoint moment is quite by accident. In the early days of my movie—writing career, I used to audiotape movies so I could listen to them in my car when I drove back and forth to meetings between Santa Barbara and L.A. The bargain—basement tapes I bought (I was dead flat broke at the time) had 45 minutes on each side. By coincidence, the drive between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles is divided evenly by a mountain overpass at exactly the midpoint of the drive. Forty-five minutes from starting each trip, as I hit the top of that hill, side A of each tape ended and I had to turn it over to the other side. One night I taped the old comedy classic What's Up, Doc?, directed by Peter Bogdanovich and starring Ryan O’Neal and Barbra Streisand. And I discovered, the next day as I topped the mountain crest, that the movie was perfectly, evenly divided into two halves and that its midpoint was a "down."
<br>
<br>The first half of What’s Up, Doc? ends as fire envelops O’Neal’s hotel room. A slow fade brings us to the next day, as he wakes up a broken man, and finds... Barbra Streisand waiting to help him — the fire was, after all, her fault! Imagine the revelation I experienced as I topped the mountain pass and the first half of What’s Up, Doc? that I had taped came to an end. The movie had two even halves! The power and the purpose of a strong midpoint was forever clear to me. 
<br>
<br>After that I began to see how many movies had midpoints that changed the whole dynamic of the film. But the midpoint does more than present an “up” or “down.” You will hear the phrase “the stakes are raised at the midpoint” in a lot of script meetings. Because they are. It’s the point where the fun and games are over. It's back to the story! It’s also the point where if you have a "false victory" where, say, the hero has been given an Out—of—the—Bottle bit of magic, he gets everything he thinks he wants. But it’s a false victory because the hero has a ways to go before he learns the lesson he really needs. It just seems like everything’s great. The midpoint has a matching beat in the BS2 on Page 75 called “All Is Lost,” which is described as “false defeat.” These two points are a set. It’s because the two beats are the inverse of each other. The rule is: It’s never as good as it seems to be at the midpoint and it's never as bad as it seems at the All ls Lost point. Or vice versa. In the What’s Up, Doc? example, Ryan O’Neal actually wins the coveted prize at the All Is Lost moment on page 75. But it is a false victory, tainted by the rogue’s gallery of crooks descending on the awards ceremony, and setting the action of Act Three into motion. The midpoint and All Is Lost moments of What’s Up, Doc? represent those for a “down” midpoint. The midpoint is either false victory or false defeat, and the All Is Lost is the opposite of it.
<br>
<br>Don’t believe me?
<br>
<br>Check out the movies you rented in your genre and see if this midpoint—All Is Lost axis isn't in every single one.

We’ve had our fun, and now at the midpoint we get serious again and resume advancing the plot. We know the fun and games are over because something happens that raises the stakes. Often “time clocks" appear here, and we start putting the squeeze on our hero(es). In most stories, the midpoint is either an “up” where the hero achieve’s some sort of success (though it’s a false success) or a "down" when the world collapses all around the hero and he looks defeated (though it’s a false defeat). If it’s a false victory, the hero gets everything he thinks he wants, but it only seems like everything’s great, because in reality the hero has farther to go before he learns the lesson he really needs. If it’s a false defeat, then it appears that all is lost, but in fact we learn that things aren’t actually as bad as they seem to be. Sometimes the false defeat isn’t really a defeat, it’s just something that happens which feels threatening – we count those as false defeats anyway. For example, in the Ring, the midpoint is where the main characters son watches the video that kills people after seven days. Is that really a defeat? I don’t think so, but it is certainly a threat, so we count it as a false defeat anyway. In Fatal Attraction, the midpoint is when Glenn tells Micheal she’s pregnant with his child. Is that a defeat? I don’t really think so, but since Micheal is married to another woman, it’s definitely a big threat, and for that reason it counts as a false defeat. In Ocean’s Eleven, at the midpoint we find out that Daniel Ocean has been flagged by the casino as someone to watch – again, perhaps not technically a defeat, but certainly a threat, so we count it as a defeat. Later, whether this beat is an up or a down, our “All is Lost” beat will be the opposite. These two points are a set. They’re always opposites. Also note that the midpoint not only raises the stakes in the A story, but in the B story as well. So to recap, at the midpoint, the stakes are raised, and there’s a false up or a false down which will be the opposite of the All is Lost beat that comes later. What if we see a story that doesn’t appear to have a false victory, threat, or false defeat? How do we know that we’ve reached the midpoint? Not every story is perfect after all. In a case like that, we know we’ve reached the midpoint when the Fun and Games section is over and we start advancing the plot again.

The section of script from page 55 to page 75, the midpoint to the All Is Lost, is the toughest part of the screenplay. (There’s a hard bit of truth for you!) It never fails to be the most challenging for me, and there’s no method to get through it other than to just to muscle your way.
<br>
<br>This is where your skills as a bullhead come in handy! The term "Bad Guys Close In” applies to the situation the hero finds himself in at midpoint. All seems fine, but even though the bad guys — be they people, a phenomenon, or a thing — are temporarily defeated, and the hero’s team seems to be in perfect sync, we’re not done yet. This is the point where the bad guys decide to regroup and send in the heavy artillery. It's the point where internal dissent, doubt, and jealousy begin to disintegrate the hero’s team.
<br>
<br>I've never had an easy time with Bad Guys Close In. It’s the weakest part of Blank Check, and Colby and I were convinced at the time that it was fatal to our story. While writing a teen comedy called Really Mean Girls with Sheldon Bull, we had a similarly hard time with this section. (Not to mention the fact that we didn't know Tina Fey was writing Mean Girls already!) In our very similar story, four underdog girls decide to fight back against the evil blonde Alpha females in their high school. By midpoint they have "out—bitched” them, sent the mean girls packing, and become the superior clique in school. Well, now what? Sheldon and I didn’t have a clue.
<br>
<br>We answered that question, after a lot of painful think time, by going back to the basics. The evil girls naturally re—group. We even wrote a very funny scene where we see them do that. Then internal dissent among our heroes begins. Popularity starts to go to their heads, each begins to take credit for their victory, and the question of who is the most popular divides them. By All ls Lost, it’s the reverse of the way it is at midpoint —— the evil girls resume their “rightful” place, and our heroes depart the field in shame.
<br>
<br>All is really lost.
<br>
<br>That simple dynamic took us weeks to figure out. lt only seems obvious now. Until we solved it, we didn’t know.
<br>
<br>That is a classic example of what should happen in the Bad Guys Close In section of any script. The forces that are aligned against the hero, internal and external, tighten their grip. Evil is not giving up, and there is nowhere for the hero to go for help. He is on his own and must endure. He is headed for a huge fall, and that brings us to...

In this beat pressure is applied on the heroes, internally and/or externally. Evil is not giving up. The bad guys decide to regroup and send in the heavy artillery, and internal dissent, doubt, and jealousy begin to disintegrate the hero’s team. It doesn’t matter if the Midpoint was a false defeat or a false victory, and it doesn’t matter if the All is Lost is going to be an up or a down. Either way, in Bad Guys Close In things get worse. (See Saving Private Ryan, All The President’s Men, The Matrix, and Spiderman 2 for examples of BGCI after false defeat Midpoints.) The Bad Guys Close In beat often doesn't feature actual bad guys closing in, but it always feels like things are getting worse. Sometimes it can be more like, "bad things happen." And sometimes the heroes are the bad guys themselves, and it’s their lower nature closing in on them. Maybe they nearly do something they shouldn't do, but then pull back and stop themselves, or maybe they actually do it – either way, this beat is really just about having a close call. Even if they did something they shouldn’t have done, it doesn’t corrupt them forever, because this beat is “bad things happen,” and “bad guys give the heroes a close call,” it’s not “bad guys win.” To get the most out of this beat, to wring the most emotion from the audience with it, we should especially show the hero’s acting bad. After all, bad guys doing bad things is par for the course, it doesn’t mean anything; bad things happening which are no ones fault are unfortunate, but that’s just life; but when the good guys are the ones deliberately acting badly, that’s meaningful. Snyder calls this beat the toughest part of a story to write. He says, “there’s no method to get through it other than to just to muscle your way.”

As addressed above, the All Is Lost point occurs on page 75 of a good, well—structured screenplay. We know it is the opposite of the midpoint in terms of an “up” or a "down." lt’s also the point of the script most often labeled "false defeat," for even though all looks black, it’s just temporary. But it seems like a total defeat. All aspects of the hero's life are in shambles. Wreckage abounds. No hope. But here's my little trade secret that I put into every All Is Lost moment just for added spice, and it’s something that many hit movies have. I call it the whiff of death.
<br>
<br>I started to notice how many great movies use the All Is Lost point to kill someone. Obi Wan in Star Wars is the best example — what will Luke do now?? All ls Lost is the place where mentors go to die, presumably so their students can discover “they had it in them all along." The mentor’s death clears the way to prove that. But what if you don’t have an Obi Wan character? What if death isn’t anywhere near your story? Doesn’t matter. At the All Is Lost moment, stick in something, anything that involves a death. It works every time. Whether it's integral to the story or just something symbolic, hint at something dead here. It could be anything. A flower in a flower pot. A goldfish. News that a beloved aunt has passed away. It’s all the same. The reason is that the All Is Lost beat is the “Christ on the cross" moment. It's where the old world, the old character, the old way of thinking dies. And it clears the way for the fusion of thesis — what was — and antithesis — the upside down version of what was — to become synthesis, that being a new world, a new life. And the thing you show dying, even a goldfish, will resonate and make that All Is Lost moment all the more poignant.
<br>
<br>You’d be surprised where this truism shows up. In the comedy hit Elf, starring Will Ferrell, the filmmakers stick exactly to the BS2 and there is even a moment where the whiff of death is clearly seen. Will Ferrell senses the “whiff of death" as he contemplates suicide in the Is Lost moment of Elf.
<br>
<br>In that story, about a human (Will) raised as an elf in Santa Claus’s North Pole, Will comes to New York to find his "real dad," James Caan. The hilarious upside—down world of Act Two includes a classic anti—thesis character, Will’s love interest, who is working as a “fake” elf in a department store at Christmas time. But later, when it all goes to hell one night for poor Will, when his real father rejects him and the world gets too complicated, we even have a death moment at page 75. Will pauses on a city bridge and, looking out at the water waaaay below, clearly contemplates suicide. When I saw this film in the theater I practically yelled out “See! Whiff of death!" but managed to restrain myself. And yet, there it was, plain as day.
<br>
<br>Take a look at your dozen movies you’ve screened and find the All Is Lost point. Does it have the whiff of death in some aspect? Most certainly it will. All good, primal stories must have this. It resonates for a reason.

<br>THE SHARD OF GLASS - june 22, 2009
<br>
<br>Lately, I have been talking a lot about the “death moment” of a script. In the script consultations I do, and in class talking with groups of writers, the “All Is Lost" moment on page 75 is becoming the most important part of the story.
<br>
<br>I'm beginning to think it's the key to cracking what your story is really about.
<br>
<br>Since all stories are at their essence “The Caterpillar and the Butterﬂy," the “death moment” is the cocoon stage for your hero, where the old way dies, lies in state for a time, then breaks him out into an amazing new way of being.
<br>
<br>It's painful, scary, and full of self-recrimination for a hero — and should be.
<br>
<br>At the heart of that beat is the hero not only being “worse off than when this movie started" — and very often in jail, evicted,fﬁred, abandoned, or left alone by the death of a mentor — but forced to face an ugly truth about himself that he's been resisting.
<br>
<br>Most stories involve a blind spot or ﬂaw the hero is not aware of. And this is the part of his transformation that is so important; it forces him to look at that ﬂaw, usually something so buried in him that it hasn't been looked at for a long time.
<br>
<br>That's the “shard of glass," that sharp-edged incident, bad behavior, tough truth or wrong done and absorbed that the hero swallowed a long time ago. Skin has grown up around its hard corners, but it's in there — deep — and it must be pulled out and looked at and dealt with if the hero can get to that vital butterﬂy stage.
<br>
<br>In Alien, the “shard of glass" for Sigourney Weaver is the horrible truth that the company she believed in considers her and the crew of Nostromo expendable — and why they were sent on their suicide mission. In Ordinary People, it's when Tim Hutton rushes to his therapist to confess he's stronger than his Golden Boy brother; that's why he survived and his brother did not. In Notting Hill, the “shard of g1ass” for Hugh Grant is that it's not Julia Roberts, movie star, who's the snob, he is. And he is what has been stopping them from being together.
<br>
<br>And it's only by having this shard pulled out of us, and examined, that we can move on to the next stage: the part where we become something glorious.
<br>
<br>What's the "shard of glass" for your hero? What old idea must be looked at and discarded? What blind spot must your hero be forced to examine to become the fully formed being he needs to become? If you can find that shard, you can tell a more powerful story. Whether it's comedy or drama, finding that piece will make all the difference! It's not only the "cry moment" of every movie - but the truth we all get to learn from, thanks to the greatest event your hero ever experienced.

The All is Lost beat is the opposite of the midpoint in terms of an “up” or a “down.” We also find the “whiff of death” here. If it needs to be a false defeat, then it will seem as though all hope is lost. All aspects of the hero's life are in shambles. Wreckage abounds. No hope. Often someone important, like a mentor, has died (whiff of death). But then we’ll learn that in fact, there is still hope, and things will start looking better. Or, if it needs to be a false victory, then everything will seem great at first, but then we’ll learn that that’s not really true. And often part of learning it’s not really true is encountering the whiff of death. In Spiderman 2 for example, Toby Maguire has decided to stop being Spiderman in a false defeat Midpoint. During the Bad Guys Close In section he sees crime happening around him, and he does nothing to stop it, but feels guilty. Then in a false victory All is Lost beat, a building catches fire and he runs in to save a little girl trapped inside. He succeeds at saving her – apparently a victory – but then we learn that one person didn’t make it out of the fire, and they died – the whiff of death. Whether the All is Lost is an “up” or a “down,” something dies here. Most famously, it was Obi Wan in Star Wars. The All is Lost beat seems to be the place where lots of mentors go to die, presumably so their students can discover “they had it inside them all along." The mentor’s death clears the way to prove that. But if you don’t have a mentor to kill off, and even if your story is for children, apparently miles away from dealing with heavy topics like death, it doesn’t matter, we still put the “whiff of death” here. For example in the kids movie Elf with Will Ferrell, Will pauses on a bridge looking out at the water far below, clearly contemplating suicide. So stick in something, anything that involves death. It works every time. It could be anything. A dead flower in a flower pot. A dead goldfish. News that an aunt has passed away. In Saving Private Ryan the team finds Ryan in a false victory All is Lost beat, and when Ryan refuses to go home, their mission, and apparently their purpose, dies. Whatever it is that dies, it’s all the same. This is the “Christ on the cross" moment where the old world, the old character, the old way of thinking dies, and it clears the way for the fusion of thesis (what was) and antithesis (the upside down version of what was) to become synthesis, a new world, a new life. The thing that you show dying, even a goldfish, will resonate and make the All is Lost moment more poignant. All good, primal stories have this. It resonates for a reason.

So now you’re in the middle of a death moment at the All Is Lost point, but how does your character experiencing this moment feel about it? This question is answered in a section of the screenplay I call Dark Night of the Soul. It can last five seconds or five minutes. But it’s in there. And it’s vital. It’s the point, as the name suggests, that is the darkness right before the dawn. It is the point just before the hero reaches way, deep down and pulls out that last, best idea that will save himself and everyone around him. But at the moment, that idea is nowhere in sight. 
<br>
<br>I don’t know why we have to see this moment, but we do. It’s the "Oh Lord, why hast thou forsaken me?” beat. I think it works because, once again, it’s primal. We've all been there — hopeless, clueless, drunk, and stupid —— sitting on the side of the road with a flat tire and four cents, late for the big appointment that will save our lives. Then and only then, when we admit our humility and our humanity, and yield our control of events over to Fate, do we find the solution. We must be beaten and know it to get the lesson. The Dark Night of the Soul is that point. lt’s in comedies and dramas because it’s real and we all identify. And in a good, well-structured screenplay, it’s in there between pages 75 and 85. And thank God, because by page 85, when the hero finally figures it out, we get to see him realize...

The Dark Night of the Soul beat is the part of the story where traditionally the hero has lost all hope. It’s a reaction to the All is Lost beat. If the All is Lost was a false victory, then it was a real defeat, and the hero is reacting to that defeat here. If it was a false defeat, then it was a real victory, and the hero hasn’t realized that yet and is still reacting to what he still thinks was a defeat, or he has realized it, but he’s still reacting to the whiff of death here. In SPR, Ryan refuses to go home, and that's the All is Lost point of the story, and in the Dark Night of the Soul we feel confusion. It's a “what do we do now?” moment. From what I can see, regardless of what they’re traditionally supposed to be, the thing all DNOTS’s have in common is that they always feel confusing, and there is some anxiety. It’s really a “we are lost” moment. Often the character is questioning their purpose, their plan, and their self-worth. In Ocean’s Eleven, according to Snyder, the DNOT is when they knock out all the electricity in Las Vegas. Snyder says we wonder what’s going on, but I don’t find that to be true – in fact they told us exactly what the plan was, and they’re just following it. There’s no sadness, no questioning of self-worth here, but there is confusion. George Clooney and Matt Damon try to open the vault door, only it’s not opening. And at that moment we feel confusion and anxiety. We wonder for a moment what’s going on, and if the plan is ruined. In that moment the feeling is, “Oh crap, are we screwed?” But then we see that the remote detonator to trigger the explosives to open the vault simply needs new batteries, and luckily, they have some with them. The tension only lasts for a moment, and then they move on. But it was a significant, powerful moment. This beat can last five seconds or five minutes. But it’s always there. It’s the point just before the hero reaches way, deep down and pulls out that last, best idea that will save himself and everyone around him. But at the moment, that idea is nowhere in sight. I don’t know why we have to see this moment, but we do. It’s the "Oh Lord, why hast thou forsaken me?” beat. I think it works because, once again, it’s primal. We've all been there – hopeless, clueless, drunk, and stupid – sitting on the side of the road with a flat tire and four cents, late for the big appointment that will save our lives.

THE FIVE-STEP FINALE [from "Save the Cat Blake's Blogs"]
<br>
<br>In my now much-touted beat sheet, point #14, however, may seem a little too simple. I call it “Finale” and in the book I suggest you use it to ﬁnalize the arc of your hero and “sum up all your B, C, and D stories." (Well, thanks a pantload, Blake!) But in teaching Cat! classes these last two years I realize I’ve had a little trick all along that I should have disclosed in the book.
<br>
<br>I call it “The Five-Step Finale.” And I use it all the time.
For those of you wondering how to end your story, and what needs to get done in Act Three, try this:
<br>
<br>Think of every Finale in terms of “storming the castle.”
<br>
<br>Step 1: The hero, and the hero’s team, come up with a plan to “storm the castle” and “free the princess” who is “trapped in the tower.”
<br>
<br>Step 2: The plan begins. The wall of the castle is broached. The heroes enter the Bad Guy's fort. All is going according to plan.
<br>
<br>Step 3: Finally reaching the tower where the princess is being kept, the hero ﬁnds... she's not there! And not only that, it’s a trap! It looks like the Bad Guy has won.
<br>
<br>Step 4: The hero now has to come up with a new plan. And it’s all part and parcel of the overall transformation of the hero and his need to “dig deep down” to ﬁnd that last ounce of strength (i.e., faith in an unseen power) to win the day.
<br>
<br>Step 5: Thinking on the fly, and discovering his best self, the hero executes the new plan, and wins! Princess freed, friends avenged, Bad Guy sent back to wherever Bad Guys go when they are defeated (Two Bunch Palms?) — our hero has triumphed.
<br>
<br>This 5-step sequence can be seen in Gladiator, Die Hard, Star Wars, and recently in Enchanted. But in truth it is the basis of many ﬁnales. It doesn't have to be an action hero or involve a castle to work. But it’s a quick way to ﬁnd what your story is really about! As I say in the blog I wrote for the Writers Store called “The Moment of Clarity,” all stories are about being touched by the transforming power of the divine, and the Five-Step Finale is a quick and easy way to synthesize that.

THE FIVE-POINT FINALE [from "Save the Cat Strikes Back"]
<br>When it comes to “structure dilemmas,” no part of a story can be more frustrating than Act Three — one about which I realize I am guilty of not revealing all. I have been amused by how often I get called out on point #14 in my 1 5-point Blake Snyder Beat Sheet — the one that is simply labeled "finale." “Well, thanks a pantload, Blake,” is the gist of the objection. And while I say the basis of this section is Synthesis, it doesn't seem quite enough. Where is the little red button that Tommy Lee Iones told Will Smith not to touch in Men in Black that Save the Cat! is known for? Because when you're deep in it, and have tried every trick you can to solve the problem, I want you to not only have that button, but to push it!
<br>
<br>I am most excited about what I call the “five-Point finale” because by using it you can finish any story. And though I've had a version in my back pocket for a while, it wasn't until I began helping writers that I realized how useful it is. We've seen how the hero is thrown into the Transformation Machine and forced to change, but how do you finish this process? Synthesis gives us one clue. But when it comes to figuring out what to do, I hope you will soon be rocketing upside down through the Holland Tunnel smiling — and thinking fondly of me. 
<br>
<br>In addition to Act Three being about Synthesis, the Third Act finale is best seen as the “final Exam” for the hero. Having started off naively, and been schooled in the world of hard knocks, he has died and been given the chance to be born anew. But has he learned his lesson? And can he apply it? There is no better way to show this test than in what I call Storming the Castle, the essence of every ending and the key to the five-Point finale.
<br>
<br>What is the “castle”? And what are these five points?
<br>
<br>1. Gathering the Team - The first step, once the hero has decided to proactively cross into Act Three, is the “Gathering of the Team,” those he'll need to “storm the castle.” The castle can be anything, from an actual fortress (the “Death Star” in Star Wars), to getting on stage at a local rock club (School of Rock), to helping your girl reach the airport (Casablanca), to “rushing to the airport" to stop your girl from leaving without you (Love Actually). A big part of being able to do this is the rallying of allies, who may not be on speaking terms with the hero at the moment, and “amending hurts" to be able to work together. It also involves “gathering tools,” and making plans for what we hope will be a successful run at the task at hand. This includes “strapping on the guns" in The Matrix, when Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss literally choose the weapons they'll need to storm the castle and free their captured mentor Morpheus (Laurence fishburne) from the clutches of... those guys.
<br>
<br>2. Executing the Plan - The second step is the actual “Storming of the Castle” when the execution of the plan feels foolproof. Sure it's a challenge, and there must be some sense in every Storming of the Castle that “this is crazy.” In fact, that very line is heard in many finales just
to let you in the audience know what an impossible task is at hand. “This can't be done” is key to setting up the challenge our heroes face. But as the plan begins to unfold, by gum, we just might pull off this crazy plan! We're succeeding! The team is working together like a well-oiled machine. In many instances this is also where we pay off the arcs and proofs of growth for the minor characters, and show how that defect they had at the beginning of the story is now “fixed” — and even useful — thanks to the journey the hero dragged his pals along on. It's all looking good here. And yet there is a sense as the goal nears that this is too easy. Sure we've lost some nameless soldiers, who demonstrate their loyalty by taking a bullet for the team (Randy Quaid in Independence Day, Rhys Ifans in Notting Hill, those way-too-happy-to-die pilots in Star Wars), but the crew is together and the High Tower in sight.
<br>
<br>3. The High Tower Surprise - The third step in the five-Point finale proves how overly optimistic that assessment was. For this is the part where the hero reaches the High Tower where the princess is being kept and finds something shocking: no princess! (For a twist on the “Princess,” check out the five-Point finale of Enchanted, which proves Princesses can often save their own damn selves, thank you very much!) But the point is made: The High Tower Surprise shows we were not only overly confident in our plan — overconfidence is one of the problems! Seems not only is the plan dashed, but the Bad Guy, or the forces aligned against our hero, “knew we were coming” all along. This is the part where “traitors are exposed" and our brilliant plan is revealed to be a trap set by the Bad Guys (as Russell Crowe in Gladiator discovers when his plot to rally Rome and overthrow Joaquin Phoenix proves to be doomed from the start). The effort now comes to a dead stop. The hero and his allies are “arrested in their tracks,” and the “clock is ticking" on our doom. It looks like all is lost again! However smart our hero thought he was up to this point, however much he's done to “synthesize” his lesson by reuniting his allies and giving it his all... it's not enough. The shock of the High Tower Surprise is learning that's not what this effort has been about. And the real challenge of the final Exam the hero must pass is about to become clear.
<br>
<br>4. “Dig, Deep Down” - The whole point of the finale now is revealed — and it's not what we expected. This is the part where all human solution is exhausted. This is where we've got bupkis; there's not a back-up plan, nor an alternate course in sight. And it's all come down to the hero — who's got nothing either. Yet, as it turns out... this is the true test! In a sense, every story is about the “stripping away" of the stuff the hero thinks is important at the start of the story, including his own little ideas for winning at the end. This is the part where the hero has to find that last ounce of strength to win but can't use normal means to do so. And lest you think this is a goofy, “formula” thing, in fact it is the whole point of storytelling. For this is the part we've waited for, the “touched-by-the-divine" beat where the hero lets go of his old logic and does something he would never do when this movie began.
<br>
<br>Devoid of a human solution, the hero returns to the blackness he succumbed to during the cocoon stage of his transformation to prove he's mastered that part of himself that is beyond human to find faith, inner strength, a last-ditch idea, love, grace. It's the Dig-Deep-Down moment all stories teach us: At some point we have to abandon the natural world, and everything we think we know, and have faith in a world unseen. This is the part in Star Wars where we hear Obi-Wan say: "Use the Force, Lukel"; the part of Gladiator when, seemingly dead, Russell Crowe finds that last bit of energy to stab Joaquin Phoenix right in his Coliseum. It's the part where Hugh Grant dares speak to Julia Roberts in the press conference finale of Notting Hill, and in Indiana jones and the Last Crusade when Harrison Ford is given a choice to save his father (Sean Connery) by giving up everything else. It's the part in Planes, Trains and Automobiles where Steve Martin, having figured out John Candy has no wife, recalls the lonely man that has become his friend and goes back to rescue him. This is the moment of faith when, with a breathless gasp, the trapeze artist, high up in the darkness of the big top, lets go of his grip on the world, does his spin, and snaps out into the void hoping another will take his hands. And we watch in anticipation, for in our own way... we've been waiting, too.
<br>
<br>5. The Execution of the New Plan - The answer comes from a place we've all hoped is real, but only the hero has faith enough to trust, and when he does, he wins... and so do we. Awakened to the true lesson of this story, the hero puts this last-ditch plan into action and it works! This is where “on the fly” the hero tries it a new way - and succeeds. Thinking fast, Hmnphrey Bogart's plan prevails in Casablanca; risking all, Dustin Hoffman grabs Katharine Ross and runs in The Graduate; going with his gut, Dev Patel answers the final question that will make him a Slumdog Millionaire. It was only by stepping into the unknown — and trusting — that the hero could find the way to triumph. This is the test. Can you give up belief in your old ways and have faith in the dark, quiet place inside? Rewards go to those who seek this moment in fiction and in life. It's the reason we tell stories and honor those who understand. This is why, when we go to the final Image of a movie — such as the ceremony at the end of Star Wars — we feel like we won as well.
<br>
<br>Because we did!
<br>
<br>Believe it or not, this five-Point Storming the Castle occurs in some form or fashion in every story! This is the “face-your-fear” part, the final test that proves the hero was paying attention — or not! And yet the risk of putting this out there is to once again hear cries of “formula!” To which
I say, phooey! 
<br>
<br>The Five-Point finale is your secret weapon for finding the true meaning of your tale. And that Dig-Deep-Down point, that “Use the Force, Luke!" beat, is what we're all looking for whether we are the writers of the story or the audience for it. Yes, this way of looking at the ending of any story also works when the hero or heroes are “Defending the Castle” as seen in the finales of Saving Private Ryan, Shaun of the Dead, and Blazing Saddles — or in “Escaping the Castle" as seen in Alien, Free Willy, and Defiance. Whether your team is on the offense or the defense, the lessons of friendship, teamwork, selflessness, and nobility are the same, and the Dig-Deep-Down moment is key. No matter what the permutation of your tale, it's the dynamic we seek, for the need of any story boils down to being touched by powers unseen. 
<br>
<br>Special effects are fine, great set pieces are wonderful, funny jokes and unique characters are vital. But if you take me to the divine in your story, I will tell all my friends about it.
<br>
<br>That's what storytelling is really about.
<br>
<br>And that kind of magic is as far from formula as it gets.

The finale is Act Three. This is where we wrap it up. It's where the lessons learned are applied. It’s where the character tics (the 6 things that need fixing) are shown to be mastered. It's where A story and B story end in triumph for the hero. It’s where the thesis of act 1 and the antithesis of act 2 are reconcilled into a synthesis. It's the turning over of the old world and a creation of a new world thanks to the hero who leads the way. The finale entails the dispatching of all the bad guys, in ascending order. Lieutenants and henchman die first, then the boss. The chief source of "the problem" – a person or thing – must be dispatched completely for the new world to exist. And again, think of all the examples in the movies you’ve screened of how this is true. The finale is where a new society is born. It’s not enough for the hero to triumph, he must change the world. The finale is where it happens. And it must be done in an emotionally satisfying way. I think that in the same way that set-up is the default beat for act 1, and fun-and-games/b-story are the defaults for act 2, finale is the default for act 3.

The final image in a movie is usually the opposite of the opening image. It’s proof that change has occurred and that it’s real, powerful, and dramatic. Just like the Opening Image, getting just the right image is more art than science, more poetry than math. Snyder says, “If you don’t have that final image, or you can’t see how it applies, go back and check your math — there is something not adding up in Act Two.”

<br><a href="the Board.png" target="_other" style="color:blue;">The Board</a> is a way for you to "see" your movie before you start writing. Each card represents a story beat/scene. It is a way to easily test different scenes, story arcs, ideas, bits of dialogue and story rhythms, and decide whether they work - or if they just plain suck. And thought it is not really writing, and thought your perfect plan may be totally abandoned in the heat of actually executing your screenplay, it is on The Board where you can work out the kinks of the story before you start. It's your way to visualize a well plotted movie, the one tool I know of that can help you build the perfect beast.

<br>The ends of each row are the hinges of your story. The Break into Two, the midpoint, and the Break into Three are where the turns are; each appears at the end of rows 1, 2, and 3. To my mind, this fits my mental map of what a screenplay is perfectly. And if you buy Syd Field's premise that each of the turns spins the story in a new direction, you see exactly where it occurs.
<br>
<br>Each card stands for a scene, so where does the scene take place? Is it an INTERIOR or an EXTERIOR? Is it a sequence of scenes like a chase that covers several locations? If you can see it, write it with a magic marker: INT. JOE’S APARTMENT — DAY. Each card should also include the basic action of the scene told in simple declarative sentences. "Mary tells Joe she wants a divorce.” More specific information will be noted later. For now, the average beat or scene looks like this:

<br><br><center><a href="scene card.png" target="_other"><img src="scene card.png" style="border:1px solid #d3d3d3;" height="150px"></a></center>
<br>You should color code your cards. Meg's story cards are written in green ink and Tom's are written in red. This will help you see at a glace how the stories are woven together or if they need to be reworked. And color coding your cards can do other things too. Story points that follow and enhance theme and repeating imagery can be color coded, minor character arcs can be color coded, and c,d, and e stories can be color coded. This will ultimately save you time.
<br>
<br>The bottom of each card should have a +/- symbol and a >< symbol, each written in a color you haven't used yet. 
<br>
<br>+/- represents the emotional change you must execute in each scene. Each scene is like a mini-movie with a beginning, middle, and end, and it must have something happen that causes the emotional tone to change drastically for better or for worse. This is very helpful for weeding out weak scenes or illustrating the real need for something definite to happen in each one. Example: at the beginning of the scene the hero is feeling cocky. He's a lawyer who just won a big case. Then his wife says she wants a divorce. So there is a clear emotional shift and a clear thing that happened. Believe it or not, an emotional change like this must occur in every scene. If you can't figure out the emotional change in a scene, throw the scene away.
<br>
<br>The other symbol, ><, denotes conflict. A character enters the scene with some goal, and there is some person or obstacle standing in their way: that's conflict. That conflict has to be foremost on your mind when you conceive each scene. The >< symbol on each card must be filled out with who each of the players is in the conflict, what the issue is, and who wins by the end. If it's more than one person or issue, you've got a muddy conflict, and your scene is probably muddy too. Only one conflict per scene, please. One is plenty. Conflict needs to be there in every scene, and if you can't find a conflict, figure out a way to create one or dump the scene.
<br>
<br>Now say you're ready to put up your very first card. I usually write the title of the movie on one such card and stick it up at the very top. In a few weeks, or months, the Board is going to he covered with little bits of paper, arrows, color—coding, and cryptic messages. For now, it’s clean. Enjoy it while you can. Okay. Time to start. Have a great piece of dialogue? Write it on a card and stick it on The Board where you think it might go. Have an idea for a chase sequence? Deal up the cards and take a look. Although you can write anything you want on these index cards, they are primarily used to denote scenes. By the time we're done, you’ll have 40 of these and no more. But for now, in this rough stage, we'll hang loose. Use as many as you want. 
<br>
<br>All your great ideas are quickly going to pile up in the board until you have way too many. That's alright. We're going to pare them down eventually. This is the time to try anything, put it up on the board and see how it looks.
<br>
<br>If you have a sequence of scenes, like the fight scenes between Peter Griffin and the chicken, which occur in many different locations, it's actually all one story beat. Eventually it will all be folded into one card, but for now you can keep it in multiple cards, which allows you to play with it until you figure out exactly how it should go.
<br>


<br>

<a href="board3.png" target="_other"><img src="board3.png" style="border:1px solid #d3d3d3;" height="270px"></a>
</center>


<br>Sometimes you'll have a black hole - a place in the script where you can't figure out how to connect one chunk to another. Well, you just have to figure that shit out.
<br>
<br>For me, my biggest problem is mistaking the cards for something other than beats of the story, something other than actual scenes. This is especially true in the early going as I lay out the setup and the action of act 1. I give myself 3 or 4 cards for the first 10 pages, which is 3 or 4 scenes to get to the catalyst, but a lot of times what I'll see spread out there are 7 or 8 cards with things like "the hero is a wrongly accused felon" next to "the hero is a saxophone player." Well, these are not scenes, this is backstory, and these cards will eventually be folded into one card named "Meet the Hero" during an actual scene where we see him for the first time.
<br>
<br>By the time you're done filling up your Board, you should have 9 cards per row, plus an extra four for the scenes you can't live without. Those can go anywhere you want. But 40 cards is all you get.

<br>1) The most <b>burning ideas</b> you have for scenes must he laid out first. These are scenes you’re sure are going to go into your movie. It's what made you want to write this thing in the first place. 
<br>
<br>2) Now the hard part begins: <b>The Major Turns</b>. The next cards you really must nail in there are the hinge points of the story: midpoint, Act Two break, Act One break. Since you have the advantage of the BS2 you know how vital these are. And even though you may come at it a whole other way, I always try to figure out the major turns first. I start with the midpoint. As discussed in the previous chapter, it’s an "up" or “down.” Either your hero (or heroes) reach a dizzyingly false victory at page 55 or an equally false and dizzying defeat. In most cases, nailing the midpoint will help guide you — and it's the one decision you must make before you can go on. 
<br>Most people can nail the break into Act Two. The set—up you've got, and the adventure, or at least the beginning of it, is the movie in your head. But where does it go from there? The midpoint tells you. And that’s why figuring it out is so important.
<br>With the midpoint nailed, the All Is Lost is not too hard to figure out. It’s the flip of the midpoint. What about the "up" or "down" of the midpoint can be reversed to create its false opposite? And it may take you some time to get both worked out. If you nail these two points, the Break into Three is usually cake. Now your board is starting to flesh itself out. It should look more like this:
<br><center>
<br>
<a href="board2.png" target="_other"><img src="board2.png" style="border:1px solid #d3d3d3;" height="270px"></a>
</center>
<br>3) <b>Check and see if your act 3 section</b> of the board is pretty empty. If so, go back to act 1 and look at all your setups and the 6 things that need fixing. Are these paid off in act 3? They should be. And what about the B plot? That has to be paid off too. And what about the bad guys? Did you kill off all the lieutenants on your way to killing the supervillain? Did all the hero's detractors get what they deserve? Has the world been changed by the hero's actions? Soon you'll find your Act 3 section crowded with cards. We need 9 or 10 of them.
<br>
<br>4) <b>Revise</b>: You'll probably have more cards than you need, so eventually you need to examine each beat and see if it can't be folded together into another scene or eliminated entirely. Eventually we need just 40 cards (at least for a screenplay.)

<br><hr><small><b>LET'S BEAT IT OUT!</b>
<br>Isn’t the BS2 pure? And easy?
<br>I use this simple one—page blank form whenever I have a pitch meeting. I won't let myself go into that meeting until I’ve filled in every space — and there aren’t that many spaces. You can only write one, maybe two sentences explaining what each beat is, and that’s perfect. Like the one—line description of the movie as a whole, I learned that if I can’t fill in the blank in one or two sentences — I don’t have the beat yet! I am just guessing. I am treading water, about to drown. Yet it isn’t until I work on the form, and try to fill in those blank spaces, that I even know I have a problem! The numbers in parentheses are the page numbers where the beats take place. A script in terms of page count should be about as long as a good jockey weighs: 110. Though some dramas run longer, the proportions are the same. I want my act breaks, midpoints, and All Is Lost moments to hit their marks. And I insist they do. Take a look at Blank Check where, five minutes into the movie, roughly page 5 of the script, the theme is stated loud and clear. Look at where the midpoint, the All Is Lost, and break into three hit. They’re perfect, and stayed that way from script to screen because Colby and I worked our butts off to make it so from the first draft of that script to the last. It worked because our structure was sound and we had tried it from every angle to make sure it was sound; it defied those who wanted to overwrite us, because we had nailed the structure.
<br>Some of these terms may be unfamiliar to you. What, you may ask, is “fun and games”? Well that’s my name for it. And not to worry, it’s found in both dramas and comedies. What is the “Dark Night of the Soul"? Again, another "Eureka!" But a beat you’ve seen about a million times.
<br>The codifying of these beats is now available to you anytime. The Blake Snyder Beat Sheet (The BS2) is here to help. But before you go off half—baked, or all—baked for that matter, let me explain and give examples of what I mean by each section of the screenplay as outlined in this form.
<br>Do you have a choice in this matter?
<br>No, you do not!

1) Any scenes that you have a burning desire to include in your story
<br>2) Anything that you already know, like the break into 2, set-up, etc
<br>3) The Midpoint (False Success/Failure)
<br>4) All is Lost (Or Gained)

+Advice like "follow your heart" and "be true to your vision" is great if you're in therapy, but if your goal is to sell stories, then give the people what they want.
<br>
<br>+All good writers are stubborn. They don't give up easily.
<br>
<br>+Liking the person we go on a journey with over the course of a story is the single most important element in drawing us into the story.
<br>
<br>+Stories are structure; precisely made Swiss clocks of emotion.
<br>
<br>+The worst thing that can happen in writing is not to finish.
<br>
<br>+Good stories are emotional roller-coasters. They make you feel all kinds of emotions. Even comedy movies don't just tell jokes, they offer the full spectrum of emotions. It's just good writing. If your story is too emotionally one dimensional, you should go back and see where you can play with things to change the emotional tone in various places.
<br>
<br>+As you edit your work, you should always be asking yourself, is this part primal? To ask, 'is it primal?' is to ask if your story is connecting with the audience at a basic level.
<br>
<br>+The hero's that you create are stand-ins for the audience, and the audience needs to be able to resonate with them.
<br>
<br>+"Give me the same thing... only different" is what storytelling has always been about. Jaws is just a retelling of the ancient myth of the Minatour. Superman is just a modern Hercules.

+The "Save the Cat" scene is a scene where we see a person in the story who we're supposed to like do something, such as saving a cat, which makes him likeable. It tends to come very early, or even the first scene we see the character in. It tells us who the character is. It doesn't neccesarily have to feature the character doing something noble, it just just has to have him doing something that will make us like him.
<br>
<br>+Compellings loglines have seven components. 1) They're ironic [Die Hard: A cop comes to L.A. to visit his estranged wife and her office building is taken over by terrorists; Pretty Woman: A businessman falls in love with a hooker he hires to be his date for the weekend] (the irony of a logline is also called the hook, because it hooks your interest) 2) the second most important element that a good logline has is that you must be able to see a whole movie in it, or at least the potential for it. 3) another thing a good logline has is that it has a built-in sense of who the story is for, it has a potential audience. 4) A good logline should actually include (/ allude to) the title. E.G.: Nuclear Family - "A dysfunctional family goes camping on a nuclear dumpsite and wakes up the next morning with super powers." 5&6&7) Loglines should also have an adjective to describe the hero, one to describe the bad guy, and a compelling goal we identify with as human beings.
<br>
<br>+Big name movie producers have the abillity to explain how each movie works in a particular genre, they understand exactly all the pieces of the story and how they fit together. You would benefit from examining movies very closely in exactly the same way until, like them, you are also very good at understanding all the parts of the machine.
<br>
<br>+When you design characters, think of archetypes. 
The "young man on the rise" archetype, a little dumb, but plucky, the type we all want to see win - Adam Sandler; the "good girl tempted" archetype, pure of heart, cute, the female counterpart of young man on the rise - Reese Witherspoon, Meg Ryan; the "imp" archetype, the clever and resourceful child; the "sex goddess" archetype - Mae West, Marilyn Monroe; the "hunk" archetype - Rudolph Valentino to Tom Cruise to Vin Diesel; the 'wounded soldier going back for a last redemptive mission'  - Clint Eastwood; the "troubled sexpot" - Angelina Jolie; the "wise grandfather" - Ian McKellen; etc. 
<br>
<br>+Whatever the story is, first and foremost it has to be about a guy who... we can root for. Or at least understand. Tell me a story about a guy who... I can identify with; I can learn from; I have a compelling reason to follow; I believe deserves to win and... Has stakes that are primal and ring true for me. The perfect hero is the one who offers the most conflict in the situation, has the longest emotional journey, and has a primal goal we can all root for.
<br>
<br>+As your story progresses, meaningful, interesting things need to happen faster and faster, more and more complex. Otherwise it will be boring. More must be revealed along every step of the plot about your characters and what all the action means. If you don't feel your plot intensifying as you make the midpoint turn and start heading for the finish, you have problems.
<br>
<br>+Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis:
<br>I like to think of movies as divided into three separate worlds. Most people call these three acts, I call them thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. The first 10 pages and the rest of Act One is the movie’s thesis; it’s where we see the world as it is before the adventure starts. It is a full-fledged documentation of the hero’s world labeled “before.” There is a calm before the storm in this world, and especially in the set—up. If events that follow did not occur, it would pretty much stay this way. But there is a sense in the set—up that a storm’s about to hit, because for things to stay as they are... is death.
<br>As discussed above, the act break is the moment where we leave the old world, the thesis statement, behind and proceed into a world that is the upside down version of that, its antithesis. But because these two worlds are so distinct, the act of actually stepping into Act Two must be definite.
<br>The B story is also very often a brand new bunch of characters. We have not always met the B story players in the first 10 pages of the screenplay. We did not even know they existed. But since Act Two is the antithesis, they are the upside down versions of those characters who inhabit the world of Act One. Again, the B story ally in Legally Blonde is a perfect example. Isn't Jennifer Coolidge, the wonderful actress who portrays manicurist Paulette Bonafonté, the funhouse mirror version of the girls from Elle’s sorority house back at UCLA? This is why the character is so successful. She is a classic antithesis creature.
<br>The All Is Lost beat is the “Christ on the cross" moment. It's where the old world, the old character, the old way of thinking dies. And it clears the way for the fusion of thesis — what was — and antithesis — the upside down version of what was — to become synthesis, that being a new world, a new life. And the thing you show dying, even a goldfish, will resonate and make that All Is Lost moment all the more poignant.

<b>[1. PRE-WRITING]</b>
<br>+Come up with a logline and a title
<br>
<br>+It's a good idea to pitch your title and logline to real people and see how they react. Their reaction can be very informative. You can learn a lot more from pitching an idea to someone in person, where you can actually see their face, than long distance. And you don't have to worry that someone will steal your idea, (that's a very unrealistic amateurs fear).
<br>
<br>+Figure out what stories your story is most like. This will help you look for clues of plotting and character within those stories.
<br>
<br>+Screen a dozen or so stories in your stories genre. That will give you clues about why certain plot elements are important, why they work or don't, and where you can change the cliche into something fresh. You need to really understand the genre your story is in so that you can understand the cliches and how to avoid them and include the things that need to be in the story in your own reinterpreted way. Knowing what category your story is in will guide how you write it. The point is to be well-versed in the language, rhythm, and goals of the genre you're trying to move forward. If you know what genre you're in, learn its rules and find what's essential; you'll write a better and more satisfying story.

<b>[2. WHILE-WRITING]</b>
<br>+Six Things that Need Fixing: 
When there’s something that our hero wants or is lacking (ideally in the early part of the story), this is the place to stick the Six Things That Need Fixing. This is my phrase, six is an arbitrary number that stands for the laundry list you must show — repeat SHOW — the audience of what is missing in the hero’s life. Like little time bombs, these Six Things That Need Fixing, these character tics and flaws, will be exploded later in the script, turned on their heads and cured. They will become running gags and callbacks. We, the audience, must know why they’re being called back! Look at Big and its primary setup "You have to be this tall to go on this ride." On the list of Six Things That Need Fixing there are other needs besides a height requirement. The kid in Big can’t get the girl, have any privacy. etc. But in Act Two he gets all those things when he magically turns Big. And those callbacks only work because we have seen them in the setup.
<br>
<br>

<b>[3. EDITING]</b>
<br>+Bad Dialogue Test: take a page of your story and cover up the names of the people speaking. Now read the dialogue. Can you tell who's saying what without seeing their name? You should be able to. Every character should speak differently.
<br>
<br>+The Limp and Eyepatch Solution: Often a story will be really good, good dialogue, good plot, etc, but there will be too many minor characters and the audience will have a hard time remembering who's who. The simple solution to this problem is give us something about each character that sets him apart from the others. This guy has an eyepatch. That guy has a hook for a hand. The other guy has an Irish accent, etc.
<br>
<br>+Editing: when you finish writing your script you move on to the editing phase. Set it aside for a week and then read it again. Note your problem areas so that you can pay special attention to fixing them. 1) Make sure your hero is not inactive. The hero should not be being dragged through the story, unmotivated, with no clear goal, not taking any initiative. That's bad writing. The hero must be proactive, it's the law. If he's not, then he's not a hero. 2) Your hero cannot be handed his destiny, he must work for it at every step. 3) A hero never asks questions. He knows what to do. He doesn't let other people tell him what to do, he tells them what to do. Or if he does, it's because he's a tricky seducer like Adraedin who just wants to make it seem as if he values what other people think, when secretly he's actually going to do whatever he wanted to do anyway. 4) Make sure your dialogue isn't crap. Your characters need to talk the way that real people talk. 5) Make sure your bad guy is actually really bad. Making the bad guy badder automatically makes the hero more heroic.
<br>
<br>+Do the "Is It Broken" Test
<br>1. Does my hero lead the action? Is he proactive at every stage of the game and fired up by a desire or a goal?
<br>2. Do my characters "talk the plot”? Am I saying things a novelist would say through my characters instead of letting it be seen in the action of my screenplay?
<br>3. Is the bad guy bad enough? Does he offer my hero the right kind of challenge? Do they both belong in this movie?
<br>4. Does my plot move faster and grow more intense after the midpoint? ls more revealed about the hero and the bad guy as we come in to the Act Three finale?
<br>5. Is my script one—note emotionally? Is it all drama? All comedy? All sadness? All frustration? Does it feel like it needs, but does not offer, emotion breaks?
<br>6. Is my dialogue flat? After doing the Bad Dialogue Test does it seem like everyone talks the same? Can I tell one character from another just by how he or she speaks?
<br>7. Do my minor characters stand out from each other, and are they easy to differentiate by how they look in the mind’s eye? Is each unique in speech, look, and manner?
<br>8. Does the hero's journey start as far back as it can go? Am I seeing the entire length of the emotional growth of the hero in this story?
<br>9. Is it primal? Are my characters, at their core, reaching out for a primal desire —— to be loved, to survive, to protect family, to exact revenge?
<br>--------------
<br>If you are having any nagging doubts about any of the above, go back and fix it. Odds are that if you, or your initial batch of readers, have found problems with your story, everyone else will too. Don’t be lazy! Don’t say “Oh well, no one will notice" because... they will.

<txt id="fsz14pt"><b>Laws of Storytelling:</b></txt>
<a href="#!" id="ThingLaws-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('ThingLaws');return false;"><b>O</b></a>
<div id="ThingLaws" class="more"> <blockquote>
<b>Save the Cat Rule</b>: The hero has to do something (or have something done to him?) when we meet him so that we like him and want him to win. Something has to happen to get the audience in sync with the hero.
<br>
<br><b>The Balance of Pathos</b>: When you have a semi-bad guy as your hero who’s hard to like, but we're still supposed to like him because he's the hero, just make the antagonist worse. Do that and it will rebalance the scales of who we like and don't like. Who we like in a story and who we hate are always relative.
<br>
<br><b>The Pope in The Pool</b>: When there are details of the plot that must be told to the audience in order for them to understand the story, that's called exposition. But explaining those details is super boring if it's not done cleverly, it's a scene killer. Here's a trick on how to do it in a way that isn't boring. There was a story about killing the pope, and the exposition takes place during a particular scene. The hero comes to the Vatican to meet the pope and learn some important information, but the meeting takes place at the Vatican pool. And we see the pope in his bathing suit, and the audience is thinking, "Wait, the Vatican has a pool? And the pope gets like almost naked and swims in it?" And while we're distracted by this, the exposition is quickly told and done with, and we never feel bored. Basically, the audience is distracted so they don't get bored.
<br>
<br><b>Double Mumbo Jumbo</b>: For some reason, audiences will only accept one piece of magic per movie. It's the law. (I'm assuming that magic here means something outisde of the apparent rules of the story world. Like in Harry Potter there's tons of magic, and that's fine, but there can only be one thing that even breaks those magic rules, as if God came and interfered in the plot. And technically that one thing is probably Harry not dying as a baby.)
<br>
<br><b>Laying Pipe</b>: You can't take too long to set up the story and tell the audience what it's about, people will start leaving. We'll sit and watch for a little while, but if it takes too long to get to the hook, people are going to leave. So don't fuck around before the audience has seen the hook. Get to the hook. Get to the main question of the story, which the story is about answering.
<br>
<br><b>Black Vet</b>: this rule comes from an SNL sketch making fun of real life movies. In the sketch, there's a black guy helping injured animals at an animal clinic, and he happens to be an ex-soldier. The tag line for the movie is "Black Vet: He's a veteran and a veterinarian!" This is funny of course because that tag line is super lame, nobody cares if someone is both a vet and a vet, yet people in Hollywood really do make things up like this and expect us to care for some reason, almost like trying to squeeze 10 pounds of shit into a five pound bag. Don't do that, unless you're trying to be lame on purpose.
<br>
<br><b>Watch Out For That Glacier</b>: very often in many stories, there's a supposed danger coming for the hero, but it takes super super long to get there, and it just doesn't feel threatening to the audience at all. That's bad writing. Threats should be threatening. Danger must be present danger.
<br>
<br><b>The Covenant Of The Arc</b>: Every single character in your movie must change in the course of your story. The only characters who don't change are the bad guys. The hero and his friends change a lot. It's simple, but true. Everyone learns something and is transformed by it, except the bad guy, who learns nothing. Everybody arcs.
<br>
<br><b>Keep The Press Out!</b>: Steven Spielberg realized something interesting when making E.T. They talked about maybe during the course of the story newspeople getting involved with E.T. and the family. After all, they had a real alien, that's certainly something newsworthy. But the problem is, bringing in the news would have spoiled the magic and the reality of the premise. I don't really understand this, but apparently Spielberg felt that specifically it broke the 4th wall. But certainly it detracts from the story and takes it in a direction that doesn't really contribute to the drama - it sort of "mundanunizes" it. Unless your story is about the press, unless it involves a worldwide problem and we follow stories with characters all over the world, and it's important for them all to know about each other, leave the press out of it.

<div id="Thingss5" class="more"> <blockquote>
<txt>
<br><b>SCRATCHING YOUR SPINE:</b>
<br>What is the so-called spine of the story?
<br>That's simple. The spine is how we track what happens to the hero or heroes from the beginning to the end. It's that thing we follow, the rail we keep tabs on with our toe in the dark, as we watch a hero we love, or at least understand, grow and change.
<br>And that change must be big!
<br>Heroes start off one way and end up another. In the comedy Liar Liar, Jim Carrey is a liar when we start that movie and by the end he's not. What happened? The spine of the story shows Jim's “milestones of growth" as he goes from one polar extreme to its opposite. And the bigger the change for any hero, the better.
<br>The problem for us is that anything that doesn't add to the spine, doesn't belong. And that's when the trouble starts.
<br>Great stories come about only with a lot of banging away on the story spine to make sure it's straight — and stays straight — because the temptation to veer off the path is tremendous. We're writers! We are lured away by flashes of light in the bushes that take us off the road and into the brambles. And the harder we try to incorporate these misadventures — the more we justify mistakes and convince ourselves inspiration trumps all — the faster we find ourselves with story scoliosis, a crooked spine of a tale chock full of half-steps, missteps, off-ramps, U-turns, and curlicues.
<br>And that's when you come to me.
<br>I love working with writers, and I love pounding on your spine to make sure it's straight. I have objectivity. So when I say your whole Act One has gotta go because it doesn't set up what the hero learns by the end, you think: “What are you, insane!? You mean that part I slaved over for two months, and even got the punctuation marks in the right places?"
<br>That's right. Gone-0.
<br>Or when I tell you your Opening Image is wrong, you are dumbfounded. That's the initial scene you think is soooooooooo brilliant because it matches up with the final Image perfectly. So you say: “That's stupid, you're stupid. You don't get it!”
<br>And I have to tell you something that may sound odd:
<br>You're better than this!
<br>You're clinging to stuff not because it's brilliant but because you think, secretly, you can't come up with something else. Deep down you protect these scenes and images because you think they're your best work, and you can't do it any better.
<br>Well, I'm saying you can.
<br>You can come up with a hundred better Opening Images.
<br>You can write a brand spanking new Act One.
<br>In your sleep.
<br>As long as you stick to the one job that is the one thing any one really cares about: telling a story with a spine.
<br>And cutting out anything that doesn't service that mission.
<br>
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br><b>THE FIVE QUESTIONS TO STRAIGHTEN YOUR SPINE:</b>
<br>
<br><b>1.</b> Who's the hero? Whether it's a solo journey like Maria Full of Grace or an ensemble like Crash, pegging whom this story is about is vital; it's who we'll follow from beginning to end.
<br>
<br><b>2.</b> What's the problem? Without a set of defects, both in the hero's character and his world, why bother watching? We cavemen are looking for clues to fix our lives, so show us yours!
<br>
<br><b>3.</b> How does it begin and how does it end? This is an exercise called Snipping the Ends that you must continually rework. What is the greatest or biggest “- to +” or “+ to -” change for your hero?
<br>
<br><b>4.</b> What are the tangible and spiritual goals? The tangible goal is the specific, concrete thing the hero wants; the spiritual goal is the under-story of what the hero needs.
<br>
<br><b>5.</b> What's it about? This question relates directly to the spiritual goal. The theme ties in to the B Story, the “helper story" that gives the hero the lesson she really needs to learn.
<br>
<br>And if you are having a hard time with any of this, force it. say “Here's the bad way to do this,” and if that fails, there's always making a list that will generate the answer! If you do this, ladies and mens, you can get into that lovely little Citroén truck, light up a Gauloise, and proceed. Whatever package you're carrying — nitroglycerin or Academy Award®-calibre screenplay — you are safe to move on down the highway. Your spine is straight, your map clearly demarcated, your objective in plain sight. It's blue skies and lollipops for all!

Believe it or not, we can critique without being critical. And we can take our own prejudices out of the development process in favor of universal truths we can count on. We start by asking questions. I've come up with 50 — from the initial idea through every phase of the script — that get to the heart of all script-development issues. If you honestly answer these questions about your own project, or anyone's, odds are you will come out way ahead. The diagnostic review is the “greenlight" checklist that keeps us all from playing a game we can't win — whether we're the writer or the producer. And because I always start with an “Atta boy," finding at least one thing done well from the last draft, we'll start asking questions at a much higher level: You worked hard. You are a tad frazzled. Well, I'm here to tell you, you're great. And we're going to make you, and your script, even greater!

<br>+Is this the right way to end the story?
<br>
<br><b>Raising the Bar:</b>
<br>+Does every scene move the plot forward through conflict and emotional shifts?
<br>+Do all the minor characters play a key role in our hero's growth, and do they change and learn a lesson as well?
<br>+Is there any line, scene, or character that is cliché, and is there any place where we can push what is expected?
<br>+What is new about this movie and, given its genre, does it move the art forward?
<br>+Who is this movie for and does the script do anything that veers from that target audience?
<br>
<br>As we get better at reading scripts and giving notes to others, this checklist becomes second nature. The idea of it is only to make the rewrite process less like hell and more like heaven. Because here's a surprise: With the right input, rewriting can be heavenly — if you know the process isn't about wrecking your vision, but bringing out your best! As long as you are willing to strike back, you, too, can win! And over time, as I've become a veteran of this process, it becomes all about doing it again... and again! Yes, a lot of our business is about repetition, and there is no greater example of that good habit in action, than successfully selling your script... and yourself. So let me introduce a slogan I first heard at the Alameda Writers Group, which I adhere to, and hope will soon be yours: Write. Sell. Repeat.

This is a note outside of the book, but connected to the book. Something in this book that strongly appealed to me was the identification of different types of scenes, like the save the cat scene. The book talks about scenes like that which occur so often in so many storys, but which I was not really consciously aware of. Well, here's a thought related to that. Those scenes are there for a reason. Those scenes all do something important, and that's why we always see them from one show to the next. At the same time, I don't yet have a conscious grasp of what ubiquitous scenes like that exist. So I can approach the problem of knowing those scenes and using them from the opposite side. Rather than being aware of what scenes I can use to achieve what effects, I can try to think as an author, what effects do I need to achieve in my story? And once I know what effects I need, I can ask, well, how do I do that? That should make me aware of many types of scenes like the save the cat scene.
