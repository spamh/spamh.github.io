Warped minds think alike, I suppose. And when I finally had the chance to read the letter itself, I got another laugh when I saw this line: “There is something l sense from what he has written in this book that is so evil and so perverse and dangerous, that I am greatly concerned over the safety of his students, and everyone he may be in contact with.” I mean, can you imagine a better blurb for a horror Writer? And the part of me that's a cynical salesman regrets that the media didn't get hold of this story and blow it up into a huge money-generating scandal for me. When I was a younger writer, I might have viewed this letter as a badge of honor. After all, one of the goals of horror writing is to make readers uncomfortable, to provoke, unsettle, and disturb. As John Trent says in John Carpenter‘s film In the Mouth of Madness: “People pay money to feel like that? It's cute. Put it in the press kit.” But this was an instance where someone reading my fiction was unsettled to the point of believing there was an actual threat in the real world. Kind of like a small-scale version of Orson Welles’ War of the Worlds broadcast. My words had such an impact on this woman that the line between fantasy and reality blurred for her—which is precisely what happens in Pandora Drive. So without realizing it, she had participated in a wonderfully bizarre meta-fictional experience—and had brought the Dayton police and my college’s administration in as well. (The best meta-fictional reading experience I ever had was when I read Joseph Heller’s Catch 22, and the paperback slowly fell apart in my hands as I read it.) I’m an older writer now, just as prone to overthink things as ever, but perhaps a bit more thoughtful and less self-centered when I do so. The worst thing artists can experience is indifference to their work. As Oscar Wilde said, “The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.“ The woman who wrote about Pandora Drive was definitely not indifferent to the book, and it certainly had an impact on her, although not perhaps the one I'd hoped for when I wrote it. I wrote the novel for horror fans and fans of bizarro fiction. I wanted to include every type of horror I could think of-quiet, loud, surreal, erotic, psychological, supernatural—and I wanted to include echoes of Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz. I also wanted to include a tribute to Richard Laymon, by including a Laymon-esque character whose repressed sexual desires were suddenly brought to dangerous life by my protagonist’s ability to manifest others’ fantasies. And—this is the last thing I’ll mention, I promise—I wanted to experiment with providing a false climax (no jokes, please), including what appeared to be a final conflict scene, only to have the story take off in a different direction afterward. (As you know by now, I firmly believe horror fiction shouldn't be safe, and that goes for narrative techniques authors use as well.) Remember how I said I overthink things? Point proven, I trust. I have artistic goals for everything I write, although I try not to call attention to them in my fiction. I want my stories to be fun and enjoyable but, if you’re interested in delving a little more deeply, there are other levels beyond entertainment to explore and, I hope, appreciate. I don’t expect everyone to like everything I create. Much of art appreciation comes down to personal taste. I hate raisins—they’re just the nasty little dried corpses of grapes—and I refuse to eat the damn things. But while I wonder a bit at the sanity of those who eat raisins, let alone love them, I know raisins are what they are. They never change. Only the people eating them do. But the woman who responded so strongly to Pandora Drive didn't simply dislike horror fiction. She was profoundly, deeply disturbed by my words, ideas, and images. Perhaps even to the point of being traumatized—and right before she was scheduled for multiple surgeries. I know she's responsible for her own choices as a reader. (Why she kept reading when she found the book was, to put it mildly, not to her taste, I'll never understand.) But I'm also not so naive as to think that my work has no consequences in the real world. Some writers decry the use of genre labels, obvious genre covers, and genre-identifiable back cover copy, feeling that such things diminish the seriousness with which their work should be taken or begin to shape readers’ response to the work before they've even begun to read it. I understand those points and don’t necessarily disagree with them. But I don't mind labels and packaging. They let people know whether a work of art may or may not be for them. The Letter Woman was hurt by reading my work. Perhaps she hurt herself, but I made the knife she cut herself with, so to speak. And I've made a lot of other knives since then, large and small, some sharper than others. I suppose it’s inevitable that when you make knives, someone’s eventually going to get cut. But that doesn't mean I like it or that it's always easy to live with. That woman did me a huge favor. She reminded me that if I'm going to make knives, I need to do so responsibly, always remaining aware that there's a person who will one day grasp the handle, pick it up, and attempt to use it. She reminded me that, as it says in theme to the old cartoon Super Chicken: “You knew the job was dangerous when you took it.” When it comes to horror fiction—and I suspect art in general—Clive Barker famously said, “There are no limits." (Hence the title for this chapter.) In the abstract, this is true. But that doesn't mean individual artists don't have their own limits, or that different projects don‘t require different limits. I would never write something even remotely like Pandora Drive if I was writing for kids. Do I believe in censorship? Of course not. Do I believe in self-restraint when it comes to writing? Only if it helps me tell the best story I can. But that means I also believe in a total lack of restraint if that's what a story requires. Do I always toss in as much sex, violence, weird ideas, and bizarre imagery into my horror fiction as possible? Nope. Do I give my imagination free reign to go where it will while at the same time keeping my readers in mind? You bet. These days, however, I consider my artistic choices—and their potential impact—a bit more carefully. And I think all horror writers should do the same. Bottom line: Respect the knife and the eventual wielder of it, but always make the sharpest goddamned blade you can.

EXERCISES

1. 

Write about your attitude/reaction toward violent/extreme content in fiction—both your own fiction and that written by others. Do you have any limits? If so, what are they? Are there any lines you simply will not cross, no matter what?

2. 

If you've identified a type of content you aren't comfortable writing in your fiction—such as a detailed scene of torture (whether physical or psychological), for example—write a scene using this content. Try to find your way of approaching it, whether that means leading up to the scene but cutting away before things get too nasty, or finding different ways to detail the experience (for example, remaining in the mind of a character who's trying to mentally escape being tortured) that are different than merely cataloging atrocities.

3. 

If you normally write extreme horror, create a grisly scene (or take one you've already written and revise it) using subtlety and suggestion instead of graphic detail. Do you think this scene is stronger or weaker for its use of restraint? Why?

VOICES FROM THE SHADOWS

1. 

What makes good horror/dark fantasy/suspense?

2. 

What's the best advice you can give to a beginning writer of horror/dark fantasy/suspense?

Kaaron Warren, award-winning author of Into Bones Like Oil

1. 

Good horror taps into our basic human instincts: disgust, unease, fear, avoidance. Those things are about staying alive, about avoiding the things that might kill us. Good horror looks death in the face.

2. 

Some people say to write about the dark side of life, you need to be immune to it.I say the opposite. It's only by being deeply affected by the world around me that I can write stories that have any value. I'm afraid of the dark, large crowds, mold spores, confined spaces, violence, unpredictability, loss, viciousness, a lack of kindness. I'm afraid of the world my children will have to live with. Be brave. Go to that place you think you shouldn't go. Don't hold back.

William Meikle, author of the S-Squad series

1. 

The short answer is, “I know it when I see it." The long answer is a bit more complicated. It's that raising of the hackles at the back of your neck, a soft kiss in an empty room, the whisper in the dark in the castle ruins . . . if an author can recreate that feeling they've done their job. There's also of course the raising of other emotions, things like disgust, awe, wonder, guilt and fear of the other. But for me it all starts with the simple things and stems from a base emotion . . . dread.

2. 

You need the ability to tap into what scares other people, not just what scares you, the writer, because everybody is scared of different things. So go back to basics to start with primitive fears that a lot of people share, like fear of the dark, or fear of creepy crawlies. Take the base idea, give it a twist, and make it your own. And if that doesn’t work, take another base idea, rinse and repeat.

Priya Sharma, award-winning author of All the Fabulous Beasts

1. 

Good horror, like any other type of fiction, is underpinned by good writing with regards to plot, structure, characterization, dialogue and setting. As to the horror element, what's good is subjective. For me, it's when a writer reveals the darkness within us and in the everyday. I love atmosphere and slow-building dread. I love suggestions rather than explicitness, although there are times when the latter has its place. I love it when a writer brings a new perspective to something.

2.

Let the horror serve the story, not the story serve the horror elements. Write the sort of horror you want to read. Write what you believe in. Don't follow fashion. So many fears are universal, so don't be afraid to bring your own strangeness to the page. It took me a long time to realize that my inner freak is an ally and an asset. Play. Write without self-consciousness or self-censorship. You can clear it up your manuscript in the later redrafts.

Jayaprakash Satyamurthy, author of Weird Tales of a Bungalorean

1.

There's no singular answer to this. As a suspense novel, Rogue Male by Geoffrey Household succeeds because of its unrelenting intensity and stoic, almost minimalist narration. John Le Carre’s novels on the other hand, are complex, filled with characters and nuances, and work just as well. It seems to me what matters are craft and a kind of sincerity—a sense that the plot serves the underlying themes and artistic unity, and is not just a box of tricks.

2.

I suppose in a way the answer to this question is contained in the answer to the first one, but I'd add: be yourself. Fear and wonder are personal emotions, but we can communicate them to others if we are true to what scares, haunts or fascinates us. Don't worry about what the most popular horror films or the genre bestsellers are working off. Find what moves you and start from there.

CHAPTER TWENTY

THE EVIL SPREADS

As I've said a few times before, this book isn’t designed to cover everything there is to know about writing fiction. So this chapter—which deals with ways of marketing yourself and your work in the field of horror—doesn’t cover everything about the nuts and bolts of marketing in either traditional or indie publishing. There are tons of books, articles, and videos out there to give you that information. Just make sure the person giving you the advice speaks from experience—and from experience you respect. There are a lot of newly published or barely published writers trying to make coin by selling their how-to’s to other writers. And there are a lot of writers who don't realize how inexperienced they are when they try to tell others how it's done (and they don’t have a clue themselves). It only takes a couple minutes to check a writer's credentials to verify if they're someone you think has solid information to offer. One book I recommend—and which I use as textbook in my classes—is Jane Friedman’s The Business of Being a Writer. Friedman specializes in up-to-the minute knowledge of all things relating to the business of writing, and anything she writes on the subject is well worth checking out. Visit her website (you'll find the link on the resources list in Appendix F) and sign up for her newsletter. You won't regret it. Okay, let’s talk about branding. Branded. Not long ago I was at a con, and I overhead two writer friends talking. One remarked to the other about how well dressed he was that day, and he replied, “A.B.B. Always Be Branding." He meant it at least partially as a joke, poking fun at business’ gurus near obsession with branding, but there was some truth to his words as well. Years back, I read an article Dean Koontz published in Writer's Digest in which he said the only thing writers truly have to sell is their unique vision, what makes them them. Back then, branding wasn't something writers spoke about—at least, not like we do currently—but that's what Koontz was talking about. And in this day, when thousands upon thousands of traditionally published and indie writers compete for readers, having a strong brand can help you stand out from the crowd and cut through all the marketing white noise that readers are constantly bombarded with. So, what the hell is a brand? Despite business types’ never-ending attempts to define brand, it's a slippery, imprecise term, much like when literary types talk about a writer's voice, although in many ways they’re the same thing. One’s a business view of the concept, the other is an artistic view. A brand is not simply a description of the product you’re offering, but of the experience. For example, someone could say that Richard Laymon (especially in his earlier novels) wrote fast-paced extreme horror. Or for another example, Caitlin R. Kiernan writes literary character-centered dark fantasy. These two examples describe both the products the authors create as well as the experience readers have when they consume (read) those products. It's not enough for us to say, "I’m a good writer and my stories are good.” This gives readers no clear indication of what you and your work are like. More, there’s nothing that stands out about it. In “Your Guide to Branding Yourself as an Author," the NY Book Editors quote Amazon's Jeff Bezos as saying, “A brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room." A brand is what you're known for, and what you want to be known for going forward. DO you need a brand? It depends on your career goals. If you view yourself primarily as an artist, producing work for its own sake, and you don't care how many readers your work ultimately reaches, then no, you don't need a brand. Put your work out into the world, and let it sink or swim on its own merits. There's not a damn thing wrong with this approach, so long as it’s what you want. But if you want to connect to and—more importantly—grow an audience, build a reputation for yourself, and maybe make some money in the process, branding is essential. And branding isn't only about reaching readers. If you’re a traditionally published writer, branding is an effective way to market yourself to agents and editors—especially in a pitch meeting where you don't have much time to sell yourself and your work. If you say, “I write dark thrillers set in the Pacific Northwest," agents and editors will know exactly what you're bringing to the table. Basic elements of branding. In order to start figuring out your brand, you'll need to look at a few things.

- The genre you write in. Because you’re reading this book, I'm assuming you’re a horror writer. But maybe you consider yourself a thriller or suspense writer (genres I consider to be horror-adjacent).

- The subgenre you write in. In other words, what flavor of horror do you write? Quiet, extreme, erotic, gothic, literary, dark fantasy, Lovecraftian, weird, science fiction horror, creature-feature? Or the more horror-flavored versions of thriller and suspense: dark crime, dark thriller, dark suspense?

- Specific qualities your writing has. What typifies your writing in terms of style and subject matter? Is it fast-paced? Do you write strong characters? Action-packed scenes? Do you create an atmosphere of creeping menace? Is your fiction intricately plotted? Your prose lyrical and evocative? Is it set in a specific region? Do you tend to write about working class people, oddballs and misfits, everyday men and women, or demented psychopaths? Are there any particular themes your work tends to focus on? Families in crisis, people struggling to survive in a hostile environment, civilized people forced by circumstance to behave in very uncivilized ways, etc.?

- Credentials. Are you a well—published veteran writer? An exciting new voice in the field? An award—winner? A skilled craftsperson? Do you have any non-writing background details that might help brand your writing? For example, if you write military horror, having been in the service is an important credential. It’s the same if you write medical horror and work in the healthcare field. Any of the above elements can help form your brand. For example, “Ms. Darkscribe is an award-winning author of extreme horror dealing with the power dynamics between men and women." 

Techniques for branding. Here are some useful practices for developing your brand:

List three words that best describe your work. (I got this technique from Kristine Kathryn Rusch’s book Creating Your Author Brand.) The words I came up with to describe the kind of horror I write are dark fantasy, surreal, and existential. (Yes, I know dark fantasy is two words. Bite me). With a little work, these three qualities can be blended into a single branding statement: I write nightmarish dark fantasy dealing with the horrors of existence. What makes you different from everyone else? I like to write horror fiction that blurs the line between reality and fantasy, between the inner world and the outer world. What's different about you and your work? What do others—readers, reviewers, editors, agents, other writers—say about your work? The horrors of existence line I used above? It was inspired by an Amazon review of one of my books: "I appreciate Waggoner as a master of nuance, subtlety, and the slow build of dread in stories that showcase the horror of existence.” That's practically a branding statement in itself! I got this from a FEAR-net review; “Tim Waggoner manages to meld surreal imagery and events with strong character work and an immersive point of view, resulting in work that shocks you on the surface and unsettles you right down to your bones." Again, almost a ready-made branding statement. Writer Lawrence C. Connelly once told me that “the world will decide how we'll be remembered.” The world’s perception of you and your work can also help you consciously develop your brand. Create a one-sentence tag (or a short phrase) for you and your work. John F.D. Taft labels himself “Modern Horror’s King of Pain.” In a blurb, Richard Laymon referred to Edward Lee as “The Living Legend of Literary Mayhem.” A reviewer on Dayton.com once referred to me as “Stephen King Meets Franz Kafka,” a description I use on my website. Sometimes your most famous (or infamous) work can become your tag, as in “Jack Ketchum, author of The Girl Next Door” or Anne (Interview with the Vampire) Rice. According to reviewers, Dean Koontz writes “edge-of-your seat thrillers.” Author Gary McMahon called Caitlin R. Kiernan “one of the great stylists of horror fiction." Lucy Taylor has been called “The Queen of Erotic Horror." If you're just starting out as a writer and feel uncomfortable calling yourself Master, King, Queen, Legend, etc., I don't blame you. I'm a midwestern boy, and where I come from, we’re taught that bragging is unseemly. And you'll probably make yourself look ridiculous claiming your horror royalty right out of the gate. How many new horror writers have come on the scene proclaiming themselves to be “The Next Stephen King,” only to fade away after a short time? But you can start out calling yourself “Author of Erotic Horror" or “Creator of Literary Mayhem" until such time as you feel you've earned a loftier title—or better yet, have such a title bestowed on you by someone else. Provide a consistent experience in your work. Consistent in terms of content and quality, yes, but most importantly, in terms of reader experience. If you're a writer who enjoys working in different genres, or telling different types of stories within the same genre, you can still provide a consistent experience from the quality of your writing. Readers need to feel confident that they will get the same experience whenever they read one of your stories. You don't want to write the same basic story over and over, but you do want readers to feel the same after they finish reading one. Provide a consistent presentation across various platforms: your writing, your website, your social media presence, your presence at conferences and workshops, etc. This doesn’t mean that if you're an extreme horror writer, you have to talk about blood and guts all the time, and it doesn't mean you have to dress in spiked leather outfits and carry a chainsaw when at a con (although you can if you want—no judgment on my part). But I wouldn't dress in bright colors and act all Pollyanna-ish on social media either. Your website, your card, your promotional materials should all present a feeling of “extreme horror” (or whatever subgenre you write) in terms of color, imagery, and text. And having a consistent logo for your name to put on all your materials is another useful branding tool. What you wear during personal appearances and in photos matters, too. Author Michael West is known for wearing black horror-movie T-shirts, Jonathan Maberry often wears Hawaiian shirts, and I wear what I call my “stupid author branding hat.”

- Changing brands. Most authors don’t just love one genre. I love horror most (all kinds), but I also love fantasy, science fiction, thrillers, suspense, and mysteries. Sometimes as authors experiment over the years, they find themselves becoming successful in genres different than the ones they started out in. Tom Piccirilli wrote horror, westerns, and mysteries before finally focusing on noir. Alexandra Sokolofi started out writing horror and now writes thrillers about FBI agents. Past HWA president Deborah LeBlanc now writes paranormal romances for Harlequin’s Nocturne line. Simon Wood started out with horror and now is a highly successful thriller writer. You’re not stuck being just one thing your entire creative life. But when you switch genres, it might take a while to rebrand yourself. I’m known for writing horror and media tie-ins. I consider myself a horror writer who also does tie-ins, and it helps that the majority of my tie-ins have been horror-related (novels based on Supernatural, Alien, A Nightmare on Elm Street, etc.). If, for whatever reason, I decided to focus on tie-in writing to the exclusion of all else, I'd rebrand myself as solely a media tie-in writer, an expert at telling stories in other people's worlds. (Don't worry. I have no plans to abandon horror!) Maintaining separate brands. Some writers who write in different genres use a different name for the different types of books they write. These pseudonyms may be secret or not, but the idea is to give books a label that easily identifies them. So Kristine Kathyrn Rusch writes science fiction as Kristine Kathryn Rusch, paranormal romance as Kristine Grayson, and mystery as Kris Nellscot. Western writer Peter Brandvold writes darker, more violent westerns as Frank Leslie. Neither of these writers hide their true identities. Their pseudonyms simply brand the different kinds of books they write. People don't buy products—they buy products from people they like. In many ways—maybe the most important—you are your brand. The way you present yourself on social media and how you interact with people during personal appearances at cons, signings, workshops, etc., tells them whether or not they like you. And if they don’t like you, they won’t buy your work, no matter how brilliant it is. There are exceptions, of course, but most readers would rather spend their money to support someone they like. So bottom line: Don’t be an asshole. Or to put it less bluntly, try to be the best version of yourself when doing business. And remember that no matter what you do, you're always branding. Play the long game. Brands don't happen right away. You can't a create a social media profile, label yourself “The New Messiah of Horror" and expect to become a bestseller overnight. A brand is a cumulation of many different things, some large, some small, some consciously chosen, some occurring organically. A brand takes time to develop. Be patient. The good news about this is if you make mistakes along the way, there’s plenty of time to make any needed course corrections. Branding can take a lot of work if you want to do it right, but the beauty of it is you can do as much or as little of it as you like or have time for. You might feel like you’re being fake at first, putting a persona out into the world that isn't really you. I understand that, but I try to think of it as putting out a curated version of my true self, the same way that I have a teacher persona when I'm in the classroom versus when I'm at home being a husband and father. They're all aspects of me, all real, but I use them for different purposes at different times. So get out there, and remember: A.B.B.! Network smarter, not harder. It's not what you know, it's who you know. That bit of conventional “wisdom” is often cited by writers to explain everything from rejection letters to the lousy state of publishing. It’s not my fault, they think. It's the publishing good-old-boy network keeping me out.  There's no denying that networking is important—perhaps even vital—in creating a writing career. But too many people hold a narrow view of what networking is. They imagine standing around at a publisher’s party at a conference, free drink in hand, schmoozing with editors and agents, regaling them with wit and wowing them with a verbal description of their latest (planned but not yet written) 300-thousand-word opus. But in its purest sense, networking is simply about making connections, and you don't have to be a mainstay of the New York publishing scene to do it effectively. One of the first ways that writers can start making connections is by taking classes. Creative writing classes are offered through colleges and universities, of course, but they are also sponsored by adult continuing education programs, libraries and local arts organizations. Taking a creative writing class can provide an excellent opportunity for feedback from a (hopefully) skilled instructor, and from other student writers. But it can also provide the beginnings of a writer's network. Your instructor will be able to point you toward resources—reference books, writing programs and conferences in your area—which can, if nothing else, decrease your writing-career learning curve. Your instructor should be able to give you advice on publishing, perhaps even provide you with some contacts. But the truth is that many creative writing courses are staffed by instructors who've published little, if at all. Always try to learn something about an instructor’s credentials if you can before signing up for a class. Ask to see a bibliography of the instructor's published works and try to track down and read some of them. Caveat emptor. But even if the instructor is far from a bestselling author, that doesn't matter much. Because the most important networking opportunity is the chance to hook up with you.r fellow students. From creative writing classes, writers’ groups are born—groups which can continue providing feedback on your work long after the class ends; groups which also can pool their knowledge of marketing and submission strategies. But what if there aren't any creative writing classes offered in your area? How can you establish a writers’ group then? By advertising, naturally. Put up notices in libraries, bookstores, and coffee shops, and post on your social media sites: WANTED: ONE WRITERS’ GROUP. Author readings and signings are other excellent networking opportunities. You might be able to chat with the author for a bit and ask questions. Maybe even more than a bit since signings and readings are notorious for being poorly attended. You may well have the author all to yourself. You can also meet other beginning writers. Take a notebook with you and, at an appropriate time, announce you'd like to form a writers’ group and pass the notebook around for interested parties to write down their addresses and phone numbers. You can also pass out business cards if you have some (and you should). You can take classes online and connect with other writers via social media. You can exchange stories for critique through e-mail and of course share those all-important marketing tips. Author webpages are also wonderful resources. Not only do authors sometimes post articles on how they got started or offer advice to newcomers, they often provide their e-mail addresses. Got a question or two? Go ahead and e-mail an author, though don't be surprised if he or she’s too busy to respond. And don’t bombard them with “Where’s my reply?" follow-ups. Annoying people is not an effective networking strategy. Writers’ organizations are also great networking resources. Often, you need to have only one pro story sale under your belt to join as an affiliate member. You won't be able to vote in officer elections or for awards, but you'll be entitled to receive the organization's publications, such as handbooks, newsletters, access to members-only sections of the organizations message boards, and directories of members (with those handy e-mail addresses). Even if you haven't made a pro sale yet and don't qualify for membership, you can still often purchase and subscribe to an organization's publications. Conferences and conventions are prime networking opportunities. Not only can you attend workshops and informative panels on writing, but you can often speak with program participants—authors, editors and agents—in the hall after a panel or at other slow times during a conference. Come prepared with questions and always bring along a manuscript or two. Never thrust your work upon someone, though. Always wait to be asked. You can also become a program participant yourself with only a few sales to your credit. I began sitting in on panels at conventions after only having sold a handful of stories. All I did was write the conference's director of programming, introduce myself as a local writer, list my credits, and relate my desire to be on a few panels. My first convention as a program participant made all the difference in my career. Not only did the other writers see me more as a peer, I was able to hook up with a writers‘ group which counted several published novelists among its members. I can't begin to tell you how much I learned from them, and far more important, I made some great friends. And that's what networking is all about, really. Not cold-bloodedly using other human beings to advance your career. But making connections, making friends. Good writing happens when good people get together. Good careers can happen, too. The anthology game. Many writers believe that the short story, while as vital as ever as an art form, is past its publishing prime. The days when large circulation glossy magazines routinely ran short fiction are long gone, and while there are still plenty of small- press journals and magazines around, many have a print run of only a few thousand copies, if that. Sure, it seems like there's a new webzine popping up on the Internet every nanosecond or two, but the quality of such publications varies wildly, and usually they don't pay—not even in copies. But there is a market for short fiction that not only pays and has a decent circulation, it also has a longer shelf life than most magazines and journals. I'm talking about theme anthologies. Theme anthologies are book-length collections of short fiction (although sometimes poetry is included as well) centered around a particular theme. Among the anthologies I've had stories published in over the years are such diverse titles—and themes—as Villains Victorious, Civil War Fantastic, Tails of Terror, Never Fear—the Tarot, and (perhaps the weirdest of all) Alien Pets. The idea is that the theme will be an effective marketing hook, and for this reason, many writers are cynical about these anthologies, feeling that the themes constrain creativity and don't lead to a writer's best work. But in a very real sense, the various “Year's Best" anthologies center around a theme as well: the best work (stories, essays, poems, etc.) published in a given year. Besides being a good business tool, a theme can be a lot of fun for writers to work with. It can provide structure and spark ideas, in the same way that a poet might be challenged by attempting to write a sonnet or sestina. Whenever I start a story for a new anthology, I always ask myself the same question: How in the world am I going to write a story about that? (Remember Alien Pets?) I find the challenge invigorating, and sometimes frustrating, but always fun. To market, to market. So let's say you want to try your hand at writing a story for a theme anthology. How do you find markets to submit to? It’s not always easy; some anthologies are invitation-only, meaning the editor contacts specific writers and asks them to submit stories. But there are anthologies that are open to any writers, and you can find their submission information listed in writers’ magazines—like Writer’s Digest, of course—and often the same information is available on these magazines’ websites. Various writers’ organizations supply market information to their members, but even if you don't yet have the credentials to join, you can often subscribe to their newsletters or market publications. The Horror Writers’ Association's newsletter always contains market information, as does the Bulletin of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. Often, various writing-related Websites, sometimes affiliated with professional writers’ organizations, sometimes not, will have message boards where people post market information. And if you follow publishers on social media, you’ll see any public submission calls they may make. Even if an anthology is by invitation only, you might still be able to submit to it. Read and research published anthologies and compile a list of editors‘ names. These editors attend a number of writers’ conferences throughout the year. If you find yourself at the same conference, go up and introduce yourself and ask if the editor has any open anthology projects that you might be able to submit to. If you can’t attend such conferences, you might be able to track down editors‘ e-mail addresses—especially if you are a member of a writers’ organization with access to other members’ contact information. Send a short, polite e-mail inquiring if the editor has any open projects you can submit to. You'll be surprised how often an editor is willing to look (on spec) at a story for a supposedly “closed” anthology. An idea is worth a (few) thousand words. So, after diligent research and perhaps a little networking, you've discovered an anthology you'd like to submit to. How do you come up with a story idea? First, remember that your story must center on the anthology‘s theme. Sometimes these themes can be broad—Love, Friendship, Revenge, etc.—and sometimes they can be very specific. I've done stories for anthologies based on TV shows like X-Files and role-playing games like Warhammer 40K where the guidelines are very clear on what the editors expect and what writers can and can't do with the characters and concepts. Whatever the theme, broad or narrow, your story needs to add to the anthology’s exploration of it while at the same time avoiding covering the same ground as all the other stories. For example, the anthology Blood Type featured vampire stories. I knew I had to avoid the same basic vampire-story ideas that all the other writers would come up with, so I flipped the concept of the vampire on its head. In my story "Sun Hungry," the sun itself is a vampiric entity that feeds on the lives of every creature on Earth, which is why we age and die. For another vampire anthology, Vampires Don’t Sparkle—which featured stories about evil predatory vampires instead of sensitive eternal teenagers— I once again went for something different. What would be more evil than a vampire preying on humans? A vampire that preys on other vampires, I decided. I titled that story “What Once was Flesh.“ Something else I did for those stories was to make them even more “Tim Waggoner" stories by using things I observed in real life. For “Sun Hungry," I used a man I’d seen for years walking on the sidewalk during the day. He usually carried a full brown paper grocery sack, and his body was almost completely covered. Jeans, hoodie (with the hood up), gloves, and sunglasses. The gentleman likely had a skin condition of some kind, and I always admired how he went out in daylight4even in summer—knowing that some people might find his appearance odd. The man in the hoodie added to the idea of a vampiric sun equaled a story combination that no one else on Earth but me could’ve created. For “What Once was Flesh," I used a medical transport vehicle from a private company that I observed sitting in the parking lot of a Barnes and Noble several days in a row. I found it strange that the drivers were never out actually helping anyone or delivering patients to hospitals. I decided the vehicle was a cover for a pair of vampires, one of whom took new vampires under his wing, taught them how to kill, and then after they fed on their first victim—under his supervision—he killed and drained them. Not only did he get a gourmet meal (human blood combined with vampire blood) he eliminated any potential competition. A vampire who preys on other vampires added to the strange medical transport van equaled another story only I could’ve written. I'd been invited by the editor of both anthologies to submit stories, but if I hadn’t done a good job on those stories, the editors still would have rejected them. But by using my simple formula—a twist on the theme combined with something weird I observed —the stories were more likely to be accepted because they weren't the same kind of thing anyone else could write. While getting a story published (and receiving a check to cash) is nice, the main reward of writing for themed anthologies for me is that I've written stories I never would have otherwise (need I mention Alien Pets again?), and they've often turned out to be some of the best work I’ve done. The themes have not only sparked ideas, they've taken me in directions I never would have explored otherwise and helped me grow as a writer. And they can do the same for you.

EXERCISES

1. 

Choose three words that describe the kind of fiction you write. If you have any professional reviews of your work or reader reviews, see if you can pull some descriptive words about your work from them. Avoid using horror as one of the three words.

2. 

What images would you associate with your brand? Try to avoid such standard horror icons as skulls, bats, ghosts, etc. (unless you can come up with a really cool arid unique spin on the image). List three. Which one do you think would look best on a business card or a website?

3.

Write a slogan for yourself, a short phrase or single sentence. Write it as a piece of advertising, highlighting—but not over-exaggerating—the positive qualities of your writing. Imagine you're a publicity specialist hired to write this slogan.

Andrew Neiderman, bestselling author of The Girl in the Painting

1. 

Surprise. Always look at what others might fail to see. Credibility. Even if you're writing a fantasy, you need to steep it in reality so the reader will accept your leaps.

2. 

My best advice is and always has been: read, read, read. See what others have done. You'll find someone who will inspire you to do something original. Good luck.

Angela Yuriko Smith, author of Bitter Suites

1. 

Good horror requires empathy on the part of the writer. We have to be able to understand not only our reader, but our characters. It's one thing to write around a serial killer, but effective horror will channel the killer. The writer will understand the motivations for horrible deeds and sympathize with the motivation. On some level, we will agree with our monsters if we want to effectively communicate them. Without empathy, we are cataloging details. With it, we create life for our readers.

2. 

Stay out of the way. We are a background character in our work. Like the puppeteer, everyone knows we are there but if they see us the magic is lost. The characters know what they want. We can suggest and guide, but the best characters have a life of their own. When we keep our opinions, moralities and judgment off the page (even though it's still working in the background) we wind up creating something independent that breathes on its own. If we don't, we wind up with a story that depends on life support to stay alive.

Dacre Stoker, co-author of Dracul

1.

I take my lead from my great grand uncle, Bram Stoker, who, in his novel Dracula, and actually in many of his other novels as well, made the stories feel real. He created a “willful suspension of disbelief” for his readers which can be very powerful. I write primarily about vampires; therefore one of my goals is to convince my readers that the presence of the supernatural in the natural world is a very good possibility. Blending into the story real events, real people and places help lull the reader into a place where it is difficult to discern which parts are fact and which parts are fiction.

2.

Read other people's work, watch movies and streaming shows in the horror/suspense genre to get a sense of what you think works and is effective at creating horror and suspense. Use this background research to develop your own style that conveys a similar message. Explore different ways to tell the story using both traditional and non—traditional plotlines: epistolary, flashbacks, flash-forwards. Don't spoon feed the reader, allow them to relax at times then put them into stressful situations, keep them on edge.

The storytelling! A great story and the Storyteller can hook you from the very first few lines. If you don't have a great story nothing else will work that well. Have you ever seen a movie and heard the reviewers say the acting and characters were amazing, but the story went nowhere? That’s true with any medium. You have to have a great foundation. Don't get me wrong, amazing characters are also important. Of course none of it is possible without great writing.

2. 

This is a hard one. There is no magic bullet and there is so much great advice out there one should know. I would say if writing horror is your dream or goal, DO IT! Just start doing it. Sit down right now, start writing down your ideas. Grow those ideas to stories. If you don't start, you're never going to get there. No matter what never give up! That is very important.

END OF THE LINE

So what's the best way to end a book like this? I could do my best to say something encouraging that will leave you feeling inspired, ready to write and take the horror world by storm. I could sound a cautionary note about how you shouldn't take anything in this book—from me or from all the wonderful writers and editors who were kind enough to whisper at us from the shadows where they lurk-as gospel. (And a dark gospel, at that.) I could tell you to use this book as a jumping-off point, a resource for ideas, techniques, and advice to mull over, try on for size, and then use to help you find your own way, whether that means adopting some of the practices I've written about or saying This idiot has no idea what he’: talking about and charting your own course. If this book helps you in any way, I'll consider it a success. I could tell you that by writing horror, you're contributing to one of the oldest and most powerful forms of literature our species has ever produced. And I could tell you that by doing so you're part of a community of writers who, in many ways, are family. But I don't want you to think about yourself. I want you to think about those who come after you. You've probably heard the phrase pay it forward before. If not, it's the concept that since you can't pay back people who helped you along the way in your career, you should help others who are just starting out—or who are a few rungs below you on the ladder of success. You might think such a sentiment is nice, but it's really an ideal that's talked about more than actually practiced. Maybe that's true in some professions, but in the horror community, paying it forward is one of our bedrock principles. We believe in it— deeply—and we do it every damn day, in ways large and small. One of the reasons for this is that we know what it's like to be the weird kid (and the weird teenager and the weird adult . . .) We know what it's like to love the dark, the bizarre, the disturbing. We know what it's like to have other people look at us and wonder —whether silently or aloud—What's wrong with you? So when we're lucky enough to find each other, it's like meeting a long-lost member of an extended family. You're one of us, and we're one of you, and it's all of us against the whole damn world. We stick up for one another, fight for one another, love one another. We take care of our own—especially our young. (Young in terms of writing craft if not age, young in terms of writing horror if you've been writing in another genre, young in terms of connecting to the community after years of writing on your own for so long.) So once you've finished this book, I want you to make your own unique and special contributions to our field. Write great stuff! Participate in online horror communities, get together with other members of our weird tribe—join or start a writers group—learn from each other, support each other, go to conventions, speak on panels, conduct workshops, teach classes, mentor other writers, give them advice, give them blurbs, share their troubles, tell them what you've learned so they can add it to what they already know and keep going. Be a good citizen of your literary community. Pay it forward. I wish you a good, long, productive life in horror. And I hope it's a scary one.

What's the best advice you can give to a beginning writer of horror/dark fantasy/suspense?

Christopher Golden, bestselling author of The Pandora Roam

1. 

Humanity is the core of good horror. Revulsion is different, in my mind. Anyone can write something revolting. But good horror comes when an author can weave an emotional connection between reader and character. If the writer can set that hook deep enough, when she reels it in, she can rip your goddamn heart out.

2. 

Same answer, my friend. Same answer.

Jeffrey Thomas, author of The Endless Fall and Other Weird Fictions

1.

Though our own personal buttons might vary, from reader to reader, in terms of what gets to us, there's a reason why so many people fear the same kinds of things. There's that universal, primal, caveman stuff: fear of the dark, fear of the things that move in the dark, fear of the forever dark that comes with the extinguishment of life. Fear of the unknown, which is what the dark actually represents. Ultimately, though, a writer can easily enough understand this kind of instinctual fear—there’s really no great revelation in it—but then we need the real magic: the effective writer's ability to activate those ingrained anxieties; to immerse the reader, make them feel like a participant instead of just an observer. If you can make the reader feel they're venturing into the dark when they're reading in a sunlit room, make them feel endangered when they're snuggled up in a cozy blanket, then you're doing good work.

2.

Open wide your sensitivities, to the world and to yourself. Pay attention to what frightens others, whether it be the fiction that has come before your own, or today's headlines. And pay attention to your own anxieties. Use what you observe and personally experience as raw material. You may not only find this process therapeutic, in some way, but make it therapeutic for your readers, as well.

Marc Gascoigne, publisher and editor

1.

I'm not a fan of the unrealistic, the fantastical, it’s silly. The horror that gets me shivering is the portrayal of a genuine, everyday threat. As father to two teenagers, a threat to someone I love and whom I'm supposed to protect is the scariest threat of all, especially if there's nothing I can do to stop it. See Thomas Ligotti’s “The Frolic” for one superb example of what actually keeps someone like me awake at night.

2. 

Have characters REACT to what happens. Hollywood's instilled in us the lie that rugged heroes and sassy heroines can shrug off damage, both physical and mental, as if it were nothing. Elsewhere, characters cheerfully learn that all the known laws of the universe are wrong, magic and the supernatural are real, and get on with their day as if nothing happened. This is utter bullshit. As an editor, the thing I find myself shouting more than anything when reading a below-par draft of a book is always along the lines of “Goddammit [author], his best friend in all the world, who he's known since they were little kids, just turned into human mush and slipped messily clown through a sewer grate—have him show at least a flicker of emotion there before he starts the next boring fist fight. Please."

Kate Jonez, chief editor, Omnium Gatherum

1. 

The best horror of all has the element of surprise. Stories can be adequately scary even if we know what’s coming. But the very best of the best twist when you expect a turn. There is no greater pleasure than encountering something unexpected.

2. 

The most effective technique I've found for writing horror is used most frequently in acting. Find a moment when you experienced (or did) something truly shocking and horrifying. Remember a personal tragedy or something that shook your world apart. Be brave when you face it. Never be kind or shy away from the horror. Tell the truth about the feelings. Live with it and turn it over and over—then write it down.

APPENDIX A

AUTOPSY

As I was writing this book, I asked myself what would be an effective way to show principles of good horror writing being applied. The answer came easily enough: critique a horror story, analyze it, discuss its strengths and weaknesses, and suggest possible revisions. The same kind of thing I do in creative writing classes all the time. I didn’t want to use someone else’s story, though. Even if they volunteered to have it critiqued in print, I wouldn't feel comfortable doing so and I'd probably hold back when critiquing it, at least a little. I toyed with writing a purposely bad story to critique, but I quickly decided against it. Such a story would likely end up a parody—whether I meant it to or not—and it wouldn't demonstrate the real issues a story written by a beginning writer would have. Then it came to me. I was a beginning writer once. Maybe I could critique one of my old stories. I still have quite a few hard copies of stories, novels, and partials that I produced in my late teens/early twenties. Maybe I could use one of those. I decided to look for one of the earliest horror stories I ever wrote—perhaps the earliest—a tale with the brilliantly original title of "Scary Christmas." It took some digging through my vast archive (okay, though several cardboard boxes and plastic storage containers), but I found it, and I now present it to you in all its glory. A few words about “Scary Christmas" before you read it. I wrote it when I was eighteen or nineteen, so we're talking the end of 1982 or the beginning of 1983. It was my freshman year at college, and desktop computers were still about a year from being something that everyday consumers could purchase. I wrote “Scary Christmas” on a typewriter. Probably an electric one. I'd started writing on an old manual typewriter that had been sitting around the house, and my parents got me an electric typewriter —a massive upgrade back then—for Christmas. The manuscript of “Scary Christmas” was produced on a typewriter, one that didn't have a correction ribbon. There were a lot of strike-outs on the pages (places where I typed a series of capital X’s to mark out mistakes). Because revising stories took more effort before PC‘s came along, I’m fairly confident this was the first and only draft. I have no memory of ever typing a clean copy and submitting it for publication. Back then I had no idea where to submit a horror story, and there was no Internet for me to research markets. The manuscript has a number of pen and pencil corrections, which I assume meant I proofread the story at least a couple times. Even so, a good amount of spelling and formatting errors remained. I scanned the pages into Word and cleaned up any errors introduced by the scanning, and I inputted any changes I'd indicated on the manuscript. Any mistakes that I failed to catch back then I didn't fix. So any errors that you see in the story aren't new mistakes introduced by my readying the manuscript for publication. They are actual mistakes from that time, mistakes that might well have remained in a final manuscript I would've typed and sent to a magazine editor. So here it is—“Scary Christmas”—just as I wrote it over thirty years ago (god help me). Following it is a critique from my (much) older self, discussing what I think works in the story and what advice for revisions I'd give Young Tim if he were one of my students today. I’lI also discuss what I see of “Tim Waggoner" in this early story, as well as how I've changed as a writer in the decades since I produced it. I'd like to ask you not to judge “Scary Christmas" too harshly as you read it, but I won't. It is pretty damn awful.

Scary Christmas

Jerry painted as he hid in the dim alley. Rats and roaches vied for what little food they could get out of the filth that filled the metal and plastic garbage cans that lined the alley walls. Jerry hoped with all of his might, which was considerable for a sixteen year old, that no one heard the old man scream. The last thing that Jerry needed was to spend Christmas Eve in jail on a murder rap. His heart pounded in his head, the world blurred for a second and Jerry realized that he was crying. Shit, why the hell was he crying over an old drunk? The dumb sonofabitch was asking for it, stumbling out of the bar like that, singing at the top of his lungs, and waving all that money around. Hell, the old man probably had wanted to die; why else would he make himself so conspicuous in the middle of the night in this part of town unless he had a death wish? Jerry froze when he heard the sirens. Seconds became moments and moments became Little subjective eternities as the sound grew and peaked, only to fade away. Jerry released the breath that he had been holding and watched as the winter cold made it visible. He ought to be far enough away by now, Jerry thought, and he took out the crumbled wad of green that had, only a few minutes ago, been in the wallet of a merry old drunk man. Jerry had taken a few seconds to remove the money from the wallet instead of panicking and running with it like so many others did. That was how you got caught. No, Jerry was much sharper than that, much more calculating. If they found the wallet on the body without money they would be suspicious, but Jerry had left a twenty there to throw them off. Twenty dollars was not an unreasonable amount of money for a man to have left on Christmas Eve after spending the night in a bar; indeed, it was more than most left with. Jerry had been careful to move the wallet around in the snow with his shoe to remove or at least blur, his fingerprints. He then used on old piece of newspaper to return the wallet to its proper place in the old man's coat pocket. Jerry knew that all this would have been mere foolishness on his part if he had actually gone through with his plan and bashed the old geezer in the head with the hunk of pipe that he carried for “insurance”. As it was, the drunk was frightened enough by Jerry when he leapt out of the alley that the old man's heart did all the work for him. Not that he thought that the cops wouldn't be able to pin it on him somehow. Not if they knew that he had been there, which Jerry hoped, they never would. Jerry couldn't believe it. When he finished counting he knew that he was now the proud owner of roughly 350 dollars. What that dumb-ass had been doing with that much money around here Jerry would never be able to figure out . . . not in a thousand years. A considerably less amount of time on earth than he had left. Jerry lived by himself in his mother's apartment. She had left six months earlier to move in with some black guy across town. Not that Jerry gave a shit. He hated the bitch anyway. He especially hated the demands she used to make of him...especially when he had hit puberty, but that was something that he didn't like to think about. Yeah, if anyone had asked him, he would've replied that he was glad that his mother was gone. Jerry had stopped on the way home and had bought himself a bottle of whisky. A cheap bottle, but then Jerry would have been unable to tell the difference between good and bad whisky anyway. Besides it all tasted like shit to him. All he cared about was what it did to him. Getting the booze hadn't been a problem. He knew the store owner well enough to know that the old bitch was terrified of him. Jerry, while not the most muscular boy in the city was enough to give people twice his age pause. He stood at six foot even and had broad shoulders, the kind which would’ve made him a good football player. That is if his school had a football team and if he still went to school. Jerry had just about finished climbing up the stairs when a rat, a particularly big and ugly one, which was saying a lot for the building in which Jerry lived, ran across his feet. Startled, Jerry dropped the bottle of whisky, which he had taken a few hits of on the way up the stairs, and watched as his plans for a merry, if numb, Christmas shatter and spill across the floor. He stared at the broken shards for a moment, wondering whether or not to go back to the liquor store and try and scare the old bitch into giving him another bottle. It wasn't worth it, he decided...maybe next week. He still had a handful of pills and a joint or two left in the apartment. He would just have to make due with them. A few hours later Jerry was sleeping of the effects of his little private Christmas party. And in his sleep of stupor and numbness and short circuiting nerves, he dreamed. He saw the old man's face, only this time it was frozen at the exact moment that his heart had decided to give out, and Jerry had the chance to study it in more detail. It was a round face; round and wrinkled. It kind of remind Jerry of a flesh colored orange. One that for some reason, had a nose, eyes, ears and a mouth. Something like a Florida version of Mr. Potato Head. The man’s hair was white and stringy. In way it looked like someone had taken the orange-head and glued old white yarn to it. Jerry would’ve laughed at such a face, if it wasn't for the expression of pure animal terror that lit up the eyes. It was an expression that Jerry had seen before, in the eyes of his brother just before he had died from the knife wound that had sent their father to jail. It was the look that Jerry sometimes saw in rats when he had them trapped. They had that same look in their eyes when they saw Jerry's booted foot coming down on them. Things began to change in Jerry’s dream now. The old man was lying there, just like he had left him; stone cold dead, small piles of snow forming a kind of shroud around him. Then the snow near the old man’s hand stirred. No, the old man’s hand that had stirred. Then before Jerry knew it, the old man was pushing himself, slowly and haltingly to his feet. He stood there like he was dazed or spaced out. Then Jerry saw the old man's face. It was white. Bloodless. Dead. And, if Jerry read the look in the old man's unseeing eyes right, it hated. Jerry awoke with a start. he sat in bed for a second before he realized that he had wet himself. Jerry climbed out of bed and almost fell down. his head was still spinning, partly from the drugs, partly from the dream. Shit, but that had been one mother of a dream! If Jerry had been a little less cynical, he might have thought that the dream was caused from guilt. Jerry never felt guilt. . .not about anything. He stumbled out of one where an old mattress served as his bed and stumbled into the other, which served as everything else. Jerry stumbled once more and this time ended up in a pile on the floor. Luckily he had landed next to what he had come in he looking for. He didn't own a television, but he did have a radio that he had taken from some punk or other. Jerry flipped it on. It was tuned, as it always was to his favorite station. They always played songs about sex and drugs and cars and all the other things that made life worthwhile, Jerry wondered if he had any pills left, then thought better of it. Better lay off for a while, especially after a dream like that! Jerry had seen things before of course when taking drugs. That was part of the fun of it, but somehow, nothing that Jerry had ever seen had seemed as real as that. Jerry dismissed such thoughts from his mind and instead concentrated on a song about girls with big breasts who happened to get off on a particular style of car. Jerry started when he heard someone call his name jerry.....

What the fuck? Had Rico or one of his gang come around here to hassle him! That was just what he needed right now! Jerry got up haltingly and made his way to the door, picking up a ball bat on his way. If Rico wanted to fuck around Jerry would show him some fucking around! Right upside his skull. Jerry stopped and listened at the door. jerry..… 

Now that he was closer, Jerry wasn't sure that there was any voice at all. It sounded more like the wind...or something out of a dream. A dream. Jerry suddenly realized that he was sweating. And shaking. What the hell did he have to be afraid of? Jerry threw open the door, the bat held high. There was nothing there. He looked around for a couple of seconds , until he was satisfied that no one was there. Swearing he closed the door. Lousy dope...Just what until he got his hands on that little punk that sold it to him! A rat stood in the middle of the bare room when Jerry returned. He smiled. Now this was exactly what he needed to take his minds off things! Jerry tightened his grip on the bat and advanced on the rat. He had met some pretty mean rodents in his life here, so he wasn't especially surprised when this one didn’t run. No, this was one of the arrogant ones, the kind that liked to try and stare you down. This was just fine with Jerry. The more arrogant they were the better... all the more fun to watch the little peckers go squish. Jerry raised the bat. This was going to be good. But before he could bring the wooden bat down, the rat had attached itself to Jerry‘s leg and was gnawing away. Dark blood spilled into the rat's mouth and all over the floor. He screamed and swung the ball bat at the rodent only to connect violently with his Leg. Jerry howled as he hit the ground. The rat, who had leapt away at the last minute, went for his eyes. In seconds one eye was a mass of blood. Jerry clawed frantically at his face. He caught the rat and crushed it in his hand. He flung the handful of smashed fur and guts into the wall, where it stuck for a second before sliding to the floor. Tears welled out of the one good eye that he had left. His whole face had gone numb with pain. jerry.....

There it was again, that damn voice! Only this time it filled Jerry with a vague sense of something that he would've once called hope. Whoever it was, maybe they would help him to get to a hospital, or at least call an ambulance. Jerry rose, slipped once on his own blood, and staggered to the door, leaving a trail of gore in his wake. He threw open the door, saying something about help. No one was there... yet Jerry could swear that he still heard the voice. The hole where Jerry’s eye had been was bleeding even more now, and the tears in his other eye obscured his vision. jerry..…

There it was again! Jerry stumbled into the hallway, hoping and for the first time in his life praying, that someone, anyone, was out there. Hell, even Rico would help him now. He'd have to!! Through his haze Jerry thought that he saw someone. Funny, he hadn't a second ago...that didn’t matter though. This person, whoever it was would help him. Jerry was sure of it. Jerry reached out imploringly. “Help...m-me....” The person, the old man, smiled. Jerry's eyes cleared and he saw who it was standing in the hallway. Most of all, Jerry saw the eyes...the eyes from his dream. Dead eyes. Jerry turned to run, blood welling anew, splattering all over, filling his good eye. He turned and ran… He bounced seven times before he died, and nine before he cam to a rest at the bottom of the stairs. The old man stood at the top of the stairs, smiling his grimace of a smile. He looked down at the twisted, wet mess at the bottom of the stairs. “Merry Christmas Jerry...and a Happy New Year." One of the things that surprised me when reading this story was how I wrote with a close, immersive point of view from Jerry‘s perspective. I had no awareness of the concept of immersion in writing fiction back then. I hadn’t read any how-to-write articles or books yet. I wrote based solely on what I'd picked up via osmosis as a reader. My memory of writing fiction thirty-something years ago is that I had trouble providing effective description in my stories. I expected “Scary Christmas" to have this deficit, and while it is extremely far from perfect when it comes to description, it’s not as weak in this area as I thought it would be. I know my other fiction around this time—most of which was either fantasy or science fiction—suffered from a lack of effective point of view and minimal description. It appears that I had learned that both a close point of view and effective description help create good horror. It's too bad that I didn't apply this learning to the other genres I was writing in at the time. And it's too bad that I didn't start seriously focusing on horror for another decade. I clearly had picked up enough about writing horror that I could’ve built on. Stephen King was the main horror writer I read back then, so I’m sure I picked up writing with a close point of view from his work. There are several places in the story where I put in authorial statements—such as “A considerably less amount of time on earth than he had left”—in a few places, something that King does in his third person narratives. This is something that I, as Older Tim (I refuse to think of myself as old just yet) would advise Young Tim to avoid. Such authorial intrusion breaks the illusion of reality for readers. Plus, it's an obvious, simplistic attempt to create suspense and tension. I was attempting foreshadowing in these places, and that's good. But I could’ve found better ways to do it. That said, if I use authorial intrusions like that now—which I sometimes do in novels, but sparingly—I place them at the end of scenes or chapters. Since we're leaving a character's point of view at the end of a scene or chapter, an authorial intrusion (which often is a hint at future events) is like a movie camera that was focused on a close-up of a character but then pulls back for a long shot as the scene ends. But like I said, I use this technique very sparingly now, although I still do use it. Not only does that bit of authorial foreshadowing break Jerry’s point of view, it's also dumb. If Jerry’s death is the climax of the story, why the hell would I want to forecast the ending so clearly? I suppose readers might read on to find out how Jerry dies, but it's not like they couldn't guess the ending since the basic plot is such a cliché (more on this later). So, the strengths of the story: close point of view and description that was more detailed than I'd expected. I also stay in the moment throughout the story (mostly), dramatizing events instead of simply summarizing them or presenting a simple dry recitation of this happens, then this happens, then this other thing happens. There's a conscious use of language to create effect—word choice, sentence variety and rhythm (even if they're not highly developed) and a sense of pacing as well. The bit about Jerry trying to obscure fingerprints on the wallet shows that I was thinking ahead, thinking about what a person in Jerry's situation might actually do. Many beginning writers fail to do this, leaving their characters to act unrealistically. I have a focused horror image in the story—the old man's ghost—and I keep him mostly offstage during the story. I also attempt to create a sense of building dread (even if it is done in a cliched way). I also have some good gory details in the story, although blood and guts hardly make up for a story's deficits by themselves. I focused on more than sound and movement, which is good, and this definitely wasn't a script Young Tim was trying to pass off as a short story (which happens on a regular basis in my creative writing classes).
So if I received this story from a student today, I'd know that he has an overall sense of narrative, of how to use words to tell a story to an audience. I would be confident that he had enough raw talent and nascent skill to write successful fiction one day—if he kept working his ass off. Now let's talk about the not-so-good stuff. I've already mentioned the clumsy authorial foreshadowing. Luckily, I only did it a couple times. Otherwise, I remain solidly in Jerry‘s point of view. But there are several huge problems. First of all, Jerry's an unlikable asshole. Why should readers give a damn what happens to him? He's not even an interesting asshole. I was surprised by Jerry's characterization, primarily because as a teacher I've seen hundreds of stories written by young men in their twenties who write about the same basic character. Always pissed off and aggrieved, usually living in shabby conditions, focused on booze, drugs, and sex, with at least hints of racism and misogyny. These characters don't seem to have jobs or any purpose or direction in their lives. (Most Jerrys usually have a friend to bitch to, but my Jerry is a loner.) I have no idea what this means. Maybe new adult males go through a kind of post-adolescent development stage where they're basically jerks? Whatever the reason for it, if I were an editor and received this as a submission, I'd think Not another goddamned Jerry story! I'm sure editors, like creative writing teachers, see a lot of this kind of character. I made another mistake with the portrayal of Jerry. Because I was attempting to write a dark story, I made everything about him dark and unlikable. I was trying to create an overall mood/atmosphere of emotional darkness throughout the story, and while that instinct wasn’t a bad one, the way I went about it doesn't work at all. In fact, it would drive away readers. Your characters don't have to be unrealistically good and pure, but there should be something about them that engenders reader sympathy. If nothing else, there should be something interesting about them, something that grabs, holds, and rewards reader attention. Jerry’s got nothing in that department.
I was also writing primarily from my imagination. I grew up a middle-class kid who wasn’t abused in any way (as I hint Jerry was sexually abused by his mom), nor was there any violence in my family (Jerry's brother went to prison for killing his father). I don't think I’d ever been drunk yet, and I hadn't tasted anything stronger than beer. I also hadn't done drugs. (I've never done drugs, but I did drink like a damn fish while in college as soon as I turned twenty-one.) I'd never been anyplace where the conditions were rough, like where Jerry lives. I don't know if I'd ever seen a rat in real life. Everything about this story comes from stuff I’d seen on TV and in the movies. It didn't come from actual experience, what some writers call earned experience. Because of this, none of Jerry’s emotions came from a real place. You don’t have to write thinly disguised autobiography all the time, but there needs to be some reality, some authenticity to your fiction. If nothing else, you need to learn how to convincingly fake authenticity. There are some signs here that I'm working toward that—the close point of view helps—but it would have been far more effective if I had written from a real place inside myself back then, instead of writing a simple idea story that would’ve been at home in horror comics like House of Mystery. Which brings me to another big problem with the story. It’s a cliche from start to finish. It’s a simple ghost-gets-revenge story that does absolutely nothing new or interesting with the trope. Creepshow, the anthology film by Stephen King and George Romero, came out in 1982. I wonder if I'd seen it and been influenced by it. The stories in the film all have that pulpy EC Comics feel. So if Young Tim was my student today, I'd tell him the same thing Dr. Huberman once told me. Don't write standard horror shit. Try to write about your own weird thoughts, feelings, fears, desires, obsessions, and observations. There's little of Tim the individual in this story. I’m not sure why I picked this idea to base a story on. In general, I find ghosts to be ineffective horror tropes to work with. Their existence proves there's life after death. So if they kill someone, all they do is deliver that soul into eternal life a bit faster. Plus, once the victim is a ghost, too, couldn't he or she go after their killer? Wouldn't the victim have the same ghostly strengths and abilities? And as far as motives for revenge go, the ghost‘s is pretty thin in this story. I think I originally intended for Jerry to kill the old man before robbing him, but I decided that would make Jerry too unsympathetic, so I had the old man just die on his own from a heart attack. I under-explained big-time when Jerry falls down the stairs. I originally had more to the line He turned and ran. I had an ellipsis (evidently I was extremely fond of those back then) and then came the words right into the stairs. But for some reason, I crossed them out. Why the hell I'd do that, I have no idea. Maybe the word into bugged me. But I could’ve changed it to onto or said He ran toward the stairs without thinking or In his blind panic, he ran toward the stairs. But I didn't, and readers are treated to a description of Jerry falling down something that isn't named until after he lands at the bottom. Maybe I was hoping to make this more a shock for readers? I remember struggling back then with how much information I needed to provide to make story events clear for readers and how much was over-explaining. Whatever I was trying to do in this passage, it clearly didn’t work. Regarding the rat attack: I believe this was supposed to be caused by the old man’s vengeful ghost, but I didn't make that clear. My guess is that this was another point I didn't want to over-explain, that I thought readers would just get. If so, I was wrong. A huge problem is that Jerry’s death has no emotional impact for readers. He’s not sympathetic and a short story isn't enough time for readers to come to care for him. That's why having your main character die at the end of a story is not only cliche, it almost never has the effect you want it to have on readers. In a novel, there's time to get to know characters, time for readers to become attached to them. Then if they die, their deaths have the potential to affect readers, perhaps deeply. Another problem is that besides Jerry, five characters are mentioned: the old man, Jerry’s mother, brother, father, and Rico. There's arguably a sixth, when Jerry thinks about the “little punk" that sold him "lousy dope." And Rico's gang is mentioned at one point, and who knows how many of them there might be? The problem isn't the number of characters mentioned. The problem is that Jerry is never shown interacting with any of them. Interactions between characters reveal who they are, can provide information, strengthen the overall atmosphere of conflict in a story, help create vivid scenes, help establish and vary story rhythm. In Jerry’s case, such interactions might have portrayed him in a more sympathetic light to readers. If Young Tim was my student, I'd suggest giving Jerry one other character to interact with. Maybe a friend or lover with whom he planned and/or carried out the robbery with. Someone to share his guilt and his burgeoning fear as ghostly events start occurring. Or maybe someone he goes to for help. Again, a friend, maybe a former lover this time. Maybe this person could be attacked or even killed by the old man’s ghost as a stronger warning to Jerry of what's to come. I tried to create a sense of building dread by having Jerry hear the old man’s ghost whispering his name. If I were to write this story today, I’d have people around Jerry speak the old man’s words, taunting Jerry now and again, without realizing they were doing so. That would dramatize the communication more effectively and probably freak out Jerry more. Jerry has no relationship with the old man. If he'd been at least previously acquainted with the old man—or better yet, had some kind of prior relationship with him, even if it wasn't a deep one—the story would be much stronger. Hell, they could be relatives. The old man could be Jerry’s uncle or grandfather, maybe even his estranged father (who wouldn't be dead in this version). Having a connection to the old man could also create conflicted emotions about what Jerry does to the old man. As the story currently stands, Jerry has no internal conflict about his actions whatsoever. The inciting incident in the story—Jerry's robbing the old man—isn’t dramatized in the story. I started after that, which wasn't a bad instinct. Starting in media res is in general a good idea, especially in a short story. I'd definitely suggest that Young Tim should have Jerry attack the old man in a revision—to give Jerry more opportunity to feel guilt and to give the ghost a stronger motivation for revenge than Some punk took my cash after I died of a heart attack. And why the hell was the old man carrying so much money on his person? This was back before debit cards, and while credit cards were a thing, they were used more sparingly. So maybe he’d have a wad of cash on him, but there needs to be reason. Young Tim only had one reason: he needed the old man to have a somewhat substantial amount of money for Jerry to take to get the story rolling. Showing the attack—and showing Jerry’s conflicted feelings as he goes about it, maybe even killing the old man by accident—could work quite well in this story. Still another problem: Jerry has no motivation for what he does in the story. Why does he need money so badly that he's willing to rob someone? Just because he’s a bad guy? There needs to be a stronger, more interesting motivation for Jerry to take such a drastic step as attacking another person. (And why doesn't Jerry just sell drugs, maybe as a member of Rico's gang? If you can’t beat 'em, join ’em.) Jerry wets himself from fright at one point in the story. I had no idea how much of a cliche that is in horror fiction. It's an overused, cheap way to show deep, primal fear in a character. And here's a biggie . . . Why the hell is the story set at Christmas? Christmas has nothing to do with the story. It could take place any time of the year. I have a dim memory of coming up with the title first. Or maybe I came up with the ghost’s departing line first. Either way, I suspect that I wanted to create a story simply to match those, and I neglected to actually make Christmas an integral part of the story. But the biggest problem with this story—among many-is that there's no emotional core. None whatsoever. I'd advise Young Tim to find some kind of primary emotion to base the story on, one that’s not simply fear. Characters in horror stories may experience fear, but the stories aren't about fear. They may be about grief or regret or shame or desire or any of a thousand different emotions. And when horror stories are about fear, they’re about fear of something. Fear of intimacy, fear of loss, fear of having a secret revealed, fear of rejection, fear of anything other than just generic, unspecified fear.
Formatting is a huge issue. For godsakes, I didn't put my name on the story! I don’t think I had any idea that there was such a thing as manuscript formatting back then. At one point, I stopped indenting paragraphs, and I know that I knew to do that. There were no page numbers on the original manuscript, either. I wouldn’t give a student this detailed a critique. It would be too overwhelming and demoralizing. I'd have him or her work on improving three or four big issues in the story. But I don’t have to be as gentle with Young Tim. I’d tell him to throw out this story and start on a fresh one. Often the problems with a story lie in the foundation and they can't be fixed. Better to start with a new idea, a new foundation, and build from there. I've already mentioned adding an emotional core. I'd suggest finding a different approach to the Ghost Seeks Revenge on Its Killer trope. Horror fans read a lot of horror fiction and watch a lot of horror films. Whatever you write, you need to repay your readers’ time and attention (which I've stressed several times before in this book). “Scary Christmas" doesn't do that. But if Young Tim could’ve found a way to put a spin on the trope—one drawn from his own unique experience and imagination—it would go a long way to improving this story. I guess I shouldn't be too hard on Young Tim. He eventually found his way as a writer. I wish the same for you, wherever you're at on your journey. Hopefully, your learning curve won't be quite as steep as mine. This is a list of general story types and situations that can not only help generate ideas for stories, but also give you ideas for story patterns that go beyond the usual predator-prey paradigm that a lot of horror stories follow I wrote the situations down as they occurred to me.
