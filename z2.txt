Whatever it is, it's deeply primal and it stays with you long after you first experience it.

2. 

Nothing is scary if we're not invested in the people it's happening to. The best horror writing comes from character . . . when we connect to them, feel for them in some way, then we experience what they experience. Now if you can merge great characters with a well thought out plot where things pay off and avoid the easily predictable? Then you've got something. 

Guy N. Smith, author of The Charnel Caves

1. 

Keep the reader guessing, don't give too much away early in the book. End each chapter with a shock/surprise. This makes it a page-turner rather than a stereotyped plot.

2. 

Do some research first. Get your facts rights. Set the book in a specific place/town/village etc. If you describe the setting correctly, and you must, that will create sales within that vicinity.

Richard Chizmar, publisher of Cemetery Dance magazine and author of Gwendyk Magic Feather

1. 

For me, it’s all about Story. If I can lose myself in the writer's imaginary world and grow to care about the characters, if I feel my heart and soul are fully invested, then I'm a happy prisoner to that story until the final sentence. That’s all I can ask for as a reader.

2. 

Read as much as you can—both inside and outside of the genre—and write as much as you can. There is no secret recipe. Accept that learning to write good stories is a long and bumpy process. Look at rejection as a badge of honor, something to be expected—and earned—even more than eventual success.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN

THE PHYSIOLOGY OF FEAR

You’d think that if writers intend to make a career in a genre named for a specific emotion that they'd want to learn everything they could about how that emotion affects humans so they could write effectively about it. But most horror writers rely solely on depictions of fear that they’ve read in stories or seen on film. They might draw on times in their lives when they were afraid, but unless they've been in true life-or-death situations, that experience is limited. Or they try to imagine how fear might affect someone. But there’s no need to imagine, not when physicians and psychologists know how fear affects humans’ minds and bodies —and that's what this chapter is all about. I used several sources to help me write about the physiology of fear, and they're listed at the end of this chapter if you'd like to check them out for yourself. Fear isn't just psychological; it's physical. Why do people feel tense during a scary scene in a movie? Why do our hearts pound and our breathing become rapid? Because our bodies don't know the difference between what’s real and what isn't. And there’s a simple reason for this: nothing in nature is unreal, and your body can’t afford to take a chance that what you’re experiencing might hurt or even kill you. If a squirrel is foraging in a field and a shadow falls upon it—say from a passing cloud—the squirrel will flee in case that shadow is caused by a rapidly descending hawk. The squirrel doesn't have a sophisticated enough brain to ask itself whether the threat is real and then look up to verify it. And if it was smart enough to do that, it might hesitate long enough for a hawk to strike. Nature has a very simple credo for survival: run or hide first and ask questions later. So just as our friend the squirrel’s body reacts to even the suggestion of a threat, so too do our bodies. It takes experience and desensitization for us to counteract the signals our body gives us. The more horror movies you watch, the less your brain will react as if what it's perceiving is real. I sometimes wonder what this process does to us. We live in a world we created in which so many things aren't real, and we train ourselves to deny what our senses perceive throughout the course of a day. That doesn't seem like it would be a good path to mental health, does it?
This desensitization is a key component of military training. Soldiers need to be able to deal with fear and not let it control them when they're in a battle situation so they have the best chance to accomplish their objective while hopefully ensuring their survival and the survival of their comrades. And even with all the training they receive, they can still experience panic. The body is that powerful. So unless your characters are action-adventure heroes with lots of experience fighting bad guys and surviving dangerous situations, they are going to experience the full force of physical fear when they are confronted with the Bad Thing in your stories. And if you're going to write realistically about their reactions—which, as I've mentioned before, is an important tool in making the unreal seem real to readers—you need to know what the human body does in response to perceiving a threat. Fight or flight response. We all learn about this in elementary school science. Flight or fight is an instinctive, immediate response to danger. The key words here are instinctive and immediate. The SyFy Channel once aired a series called Scare Tactics in which unsuspecting people were subjected to nightmare scenarios to see how they'd react. As far as I’m concerned, shows like this are cruel and highly unethical, but they are instructive for horror writers. We get to see real people responding to what they believe is an actual Bad Thing. One episode featured a group of people being driven in a limo down a desert road. The vehicle lost power, its engine died, and it rolled to a stop. Strange lights appeared and an alien creature approached the car and tore off one of the doors. Everyone in the limo—the man's friends and his girlfriend, along with the driver—was in on the prank except for one poor bastard. The moment the “alien” pulled off the door, the man threw open the opposite door, shot out of the limo, and sped away from the car like he was the Flash. He didn’t yell, didn’t scream, didn’t say anything to his companions. He just bolted. I sometimes wonder what his girlfriend thought about how he abandoned her without a second’s hesitation. I wouldn’t be surprised if their relationship ended soon after that episode finished filming. The man’s reaction was completely unthinking. His body reacted before his mind could even begin to process what was happening. Instinctively and immediately. A different person might have jumped out of the car and attacked the alien, again without thinking. And the thing is, none of us can know how we'd react in a threatening situation until it happens. I think a lot of people—maybe most—would either freeze in place or try to hide. Both of these reactions could be slotted into the flight category, I suppose. They are ways to try to escape a threat. There are all kinds of ways to fight, too. In King’s story “Lunch at the Gotham Café," a husband and wife on the verge of divorce meet at a cafe. The husband wants to reconcile with the wife, but the wife is ambivalent about the idea. One of the waiters has a psychotic break and starts killing the staff and diners. The husband, wanting to get his wife to safety, grabs hold of her hand and leads her to the kitchen. The homicidal waiter follows, blood-slick knife in hand. The husband stands in front of his wife to protect her, and she plants a foot on his lower back and shoves him toward the waiter. She fights by offering someone else as a sacrifice to the Bad Thing. This action was instinctive on her part, but it also revealed an important truth about her character and about how she felt about her husband and their marriage. As with anything else in a story, how a character responds to an immediate threat tells us—not to mention the other characters in the story—a great deal about them. One of the things to ask yourself about your characters is which reaction they would have to danger. Fight or flight? And how specifically would they do either? Try to vary how your characters would respond so you don't have all of them hauling ass away from the threat as a group or rushing toward it to confront it. Plus, if their reaction is surprising and maybe even shameful to them, it can add another interesting layer to their character and have consequences for the rest of the story. After that Scare Tactics episode with the fake UFO landing and alien attack, do you think the terrified man's friends would trust him to stand with them in a dangerous—or even merely stressful—situation and help them? Hell, no. They would feel as if they couldn't rely on him, that they couldn’t trust him. And that would make for a useful complication in a story. Low road and high road. These terms are ways to describe the two levels of fear response. The low road is an immediate, more physical reaction. The high road is a bit slower, more thoughtful. Both happen simultaneously. Your body and your mind react to a fear stimulus in your environment at the same time. Your body gets the jump on your mind, but the mind isn't far behind. The man in Scare Tactics reached for the door as the rubber-suited “alien” approached the limo. That was his body reacting first. But then his mind would've kicked in and he could’ve told himself Aliens aren't real. This isn't real. What the hell's going on? In that case, he might have hesitated, waiting to get more data before responding further. Or he might’ve figured Screw it, Maybe it's real, maybe it's not, but I ’m out of here. Knowing that low road and high road reactions both occur, in that order, will help you write more effectively about how your characters react to an immediate threat. The high road can temper or even counteract the low road. A character like Sherlock Holmes or Spock might have an initial physical reaction to a threat, but their powerful intellects would quickly override that reaction, reasserting control and allowing them to act rationally. Knowing your characters’ low road reaction to fear and their high road reaction will allow you to write about them facing danger even more realistically. Plus, if there's conflict between their low and high road reactions, you can evoke more tension in a scene. It's all in your head. During a fear response, your hypothalamus simultaneously activates the sympathetic nervous system (which triggers nerves) and the adrenal-cortex system (which dumps hormones into the body). The sympathetic nervous system causes the body to become tense and alert. The adrenal-cortical system is activated, releasing thirty different hormones into the body to prepare to handle the threat. Physical reactions caused by hormones released in the fear response. Among these reactions are: 

- Increased heart rate and blood pressure.

- Dilated pupils to take in as much light as possible.

- Constriction of veins in skin, which causes the chilly sensation associated with fear.

- Increased blood glucose.

- Tensing of muscles and goose bumps.

- Relaxation of smooth muscles.

- Shutting down of nonessential systems such as digestion and the immune system.

- Difficulty concentrating on small tasks (brain is directed to focus on the big picture).

Now you wouldn't describe all those things in a scene. Writing Bob saw the monster approaching, and in response he felt his smooth muscles relax would be ridiculous. Besides, we’re not aware of all these different things happening at the time. But we'd be aware of our bodies tensing, of our heart rate increasing, and we might also be aware of our inability to focus on details (especially if we start running and fail to see something small right in front of us and trip over it). Or if we're frantically searching through our key ring to find our house key—the one we use every day—but can't recognize it because we're too scared of the Bad Thing behind us to focus. Once the threat diminishes, the body releases cortisol to calm itself back down. This calming is not instantaneous, nor is it comfortable. You may feel weak, shaky, dizzy, nauseated. Maybe you'll throw up, or maybe you'll get a bad headache. The stress chemicals in your body don't just vanish altogether, and you might feel extremely nervous for a time after the danger has passed. Effects of long-term exposure to stress-related hormones. Stress hormones take a toll on the human body. Here are some of the effects your characters might experience:

- More colds and infections.

- Sexual disorders.

- Aches and pains.

- Fatigue.

- Loss of appetite.

Post-traumatic stress disorder. 

PTSD is real and it affects more than soldiers returning home from war. Anyone who's experienced trauma, especially repeated trauma over time, can have PTSD. So if any of your characters had an encounter with a Bad Thing in the past, like the kids in It, they might well experience some of the following effects associated with PTSD. And a number of these effects could lead to important conflicts/complications in a story. Sufferers often have elevated levels of the hormones associated with fight or flight. (So they might react either way but far more swiftly—and perhaps dramatically—than other characters.) They may experience symptoms when the situation doesn’t warrant it. (They can have flashbacks triggered by seemingly harmless stimuli. The smell of lilacs brings back the emotions of being abused by someone wearing lilac scent, for example. Or a character reacts to a loud noise as if it's a gun firing.) Bodies may react as though a threat is real when reminded of a traumatic event. (Again, flashbacks triggered by stimuli. A character could even encounter something specifically related to the traumatic event: they could unexpectedly run into a former abuser in public, see a photo of a crime scene they were involved in, etc.) The body loses the ability to shut off‘ the process when it's not needed. (Random panic attacks for seemingly no reason. Your brain and body are hyper-ready to go into fight or flight mode at anything even remotely resembling danger.) 

Depression.

Substance abuse. (Characters might try to self—medicate without realizing that’s what they're doing.)

Memory and cognition problems.

Difficulty functioning in social or family life.

Occupational instability.

Marital problems and divorces.

- Family discord.

- Difficulty parenting.

So how does all this impact your writing? Answer these questions for the characters in your story:

- How does your character's body work during fear? After fear?

- How do your character's senses perform during fear?

- How effectively can your character process information when experiencing fear?

- How does your character react long-term to fear?

- Has past trauma for your character resulted in PTSD? If so, what effects of PTSD are your character experiencing?

- Has your character gotten any help, professional or otherwise, for long-term effects of fear? The more you know about how your characters experience and respond to fear, the more realistically you'll be able to portray them in your horror fiction—and the more story possibilities you’ll open up.

VOICES FROM THE SHADOWS

1. 

What makes good horror/dark fantasy/suspense?

2. 

What's the best advice you can give a beginning writer of horror/dark fantasy/suspense?

Don D’Auria, executive editor of Flame Tree Press

1. 

For me the key to good, effective horror is emotion, and by that I don’t mean just the obvious emotion of fear. We need all emotion; we need to see the characters as real people, and we need to become emotionally involved with them. Without that, all we have are cardboard cutouts being threatened or killed. But if we can identify with the characters as people, if we can feel what they’re feeling, then we care much more about their survival and the book or story becomes much more powerful.

2.

It's old advice, but if you want to write in any genre, you need to read in that genre. I'm not suggesting you become derivative or copy anyone, but if you read, you can see what works for you, you can see how other writers have handled certain aspects of writing. You can see how a particular author mastered pacing, for example, or how another drew you into the story through characterization. You can learn different styles, different techniques. Then incorporate the best of what you've learned into your own distinct style.

Stephanie M. Wytovich, award-winning author of The Apocalyptic Mannequin

1.

For me, good horror/dark fantasy/suspense—and honestly, good literature in general—contains a story that makes me challenge everything I've been taught to believe is true: my faith, my morals, my political associations, etc. I want something that is going to force me to dissect my relationship with my version of what I know to be true, and that way, I'm not only putting myself into the story, but it's shaping and reshaping my ideology of who I am on this planet. A good horror story (and a good scare) can do a lot of good in the world, and the opportunity for social commentary alongside a monstrous creature is both rife and palpable, a piece of entertainment and an invitation to evaluate the world around you. 

2.

Research. Horror is an intense genre for a lot of different reasons and its fans are serious diehards, which is great, but they'll definitely know if something is off in the story or not factually correct. Having said that, you'll want to take the time to thoroughly research your subject material and ask questions if you need to, both to professionals in the field you're writing about, or to your colleagues and friends. Also note that we have a wonderful community that is always ready to help and provide resources and experiences that can help your story jump off the page, so get involved, read everything, and throw out that old adage, “Write what you know.” Challenge yourself. Learn. Your readers will love you for it because that material will be fresh, realistic, and if done right, equally terrifying.

Russell R. James, author of The Playing Card Killer

1.

The best horror taps into the reader's deepest fears. Often these change over time. In 1956, Invasion of the Body Snatchers played on fears of Communist infiltration creating a soulless society. Today Black Mirror exploits our anxiety about technology's impact on our future.

2.

To write the most effective horror, make the reader care about the character in danger. Once the reader is invested in that character, the reader will feel the terror the protagonist feels, instead of just reading about it. 

Matt Cardin, author of To Rouse Leviathan

1.

Good writing of this type fuses horror and dread with a kind of hypnotic fascination. It's an ancient paradox: What's dreadful is also, somehow, mesmerizing. We're drawn to what terrifies and horrifies us. The best stories of horror, dark fantasy, and/or suspense tend to be rooted squarely in this primal emotional effect.

2.

a) Gorge yourself on reading. Don't limit yourself to horror/dark/fantasy/suspense. b) Devote some reflection to how this type of writing works, how it functions as narrative storytelling to cast that dark spell of fear and fascination. c) Search for the center of your own response. Divine the core of your personal attraction to tales of darkness and dread. Learn to write from this core. d) Find your native subject matter, the idiosyncratic theme or themes that your life has naturally geared you to care about and write about. Note that these are your master map not just for writing but for life. e) Master the technical side: grammar, punctuation, spelling, sentence structure, stylistic and rhetorical modes. This is non-negotiable. f) Learn to court the muse. Honor her when she shows up and speaks. It's not perspiration versus inspiration, it's both at once. It's inspiration manifested through perspiration. g) Learn when to ignore advice, including this right here.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN

TELL ME A SCARY STORY

Teaching beginning writers how to plot is hard. In essence, you're trying to teach someone how to build something when they can't touch the materials they're working with, can't watch a demonstration of someone building the thing, can't get their hands on a finished physical product to take apart, can't follow a pre-made step-by-step blueprint, and so on. Creative writing g teachers show their students visual representations of plot structure in the hope that it'll help. But there's really not much to show about Classic Plot Design, which follows the ever-popular Hero's Journey. It's a simple linear progression from beginning to end, with a few basic elements labeled. There's nothing wrong with the Hero's Journey pattern. But the diagram doesn't give writers much to work with, and it really doesn't help people who don't think linearly as they create—which, let's face it, is most of us. Classic Plot Design is especially unhelpful for writers who wish to produce more literary, character-centered fiction. Still, Classic Plot Design has been around for a hell of a long time, and that's because general audiences respond to it so well. So we'll discuss it in this chapter, along with alternative techniques for plotting. First off, let's talk about writing the short stuff.

ADVICE FOR WRITING SHORT STORIES

Length. 

As a rule of thumb, short stories tend to be around 1,000-5,000 words (4-20 pages). They of course can be shorter or longer, but this is a solidly marketable range, as well as a good range for beginners. It's long enough to practice the basics but not so long that writers are too intimidated to revise.

Keep it simple. 

Keep your ambitions in check when learning to write short stories. Avoid massive research or worldbuilding. Elaborate research and worldbuilding can make a story so complicated that you can't properly tend to the basics of characterization, dialogue, etc.

Story content. 

Use violence, sex, politics, profanity, religion, etc. when necessary to serve the needs of the story. Don’t try to shock readers with naughty words and sexy scenes or beat them over the head with political or religious messages. The story is what's most important. But follow market guidelines, too. If a magazine says that it will not publish a story that portrays violence against children, don't submit that kind of story to that particular market. Editors say beginning writers ignore their guidelines all the time, and it's a sure way to receive a fast rejection.

Short time frame. 

One way to keep a short story under control—as well as to maximize its intensity—is to limit the events to a relatively short amount of time: minutes, hours, maybe a day or two at most. Limit the number of characters. Only have two or three main characters, and don't add too many supporting characters. There‘s not a lot of room in a short story (obviously), and because of this, you don't have the opportunity to fully develop more than a couple characters, and there's only enough time for readers to become emotionally invested in one or two. If you have too many characters in a story, it makes the story too complex for its length and makes it difficult—if not impossible—for readers to connect emotionally.

Limit the setting. 

Another way to maintain focus in a short story is to confine the action to one setting. This can be as limited as one room, one house, one street, one town, etc. The fewer settings there are in your story, the fewer times readers’ imaginations will be yanked from one setting and plunked down into another. Such transitions can be jarring for readers, and unless you're looking to create such a jarring effect, keeping the setting limited works best. 

Point of view. 

In general, stick to one character’s point of view in a short story. As I said above, too many shifts in a story can be jarring for readers. Readers need time to attach to a point of view in a story, and while novels have plenty of room for readers to become attached to multiple viewpoints, a short story doesn't. 

Simple story problem. 

Stick to one main story problem. Again, novels have room for multiple—and major and minor—story problems. Short stories do not. Stay focused on one story problem, and your story will have more impact on readers.

Scenes. 

In general, try not to have more than two or three scenes in a short story. Again, for the same reason I keep mentioning: short stories don't have a lot of room.

Obstacles. 

Avoid having too many obstacles (because . . . you guessed it: short stories are short). There’s room for a number of simple obstacles, such as a locked door or a character who momentarily doubts another. There's less room for major obstacles such as an earthquake or a Kaiju attack. Begin close to the end. One way to keep a story short and focused is to begin telling it as close to the climax as you can. If I was writing a story about a person trying to defuse a bomb, I’d begin with the character already in the process of defusing it, and then I'd work in whatever backstory was needed, prob ably in the form of short snatches of memory that pass through the person's mind, distracting him or her while working. Not only is this a great way to keep your story focused, it can maximize story tension as well. 

Plotting novels. 

“The novel is a prose narrative of some length that has something wrong with it." —Randall Jarrell

“There are three rules to writing a novel. Unfortunately, no one knows what they are." —W. Somerset Maugham

“A story should have a beginning, a muddle, and an end." —Philip Larkin

Length: 

50,000 words minimum. No maximum length, but publishers most often call for lengths between 80,000 to 120,000 words,

Novels vs. short stories. 

A short story is an event; a novel is a series of events that add up to a much larger journey.

- There are (or at least can be) a greater number of characters: major and minor.

- You can explore the setting in greater detail and perhaps have multiple settings.

- You can explore the history or background of your characters and setting in more detail.

- The conflict tends to be deeper and more widespread.

- There's more opportunity to explore them in greater depth.

If you're just starting to write novels . . . Writing a novel for the first time (or first few times) is hard enough. Don't make it harder on yourself than it needs to be while you're still learning how to do it. With that in mind, here are some tips to make writing a novel more manageable.

- Avoid super complex structures—lots of flashbacks, a zillion subplots, multi-generational sagas.

- Avoid having a ton of characters in your novel.

- Avoid switching between too many settings.

- Avoid stories that require a massive amount of research.

Action-Idea. 

Over the years in my creative writing classes, I noticed that student fiction—short stories and novels both—didn’t have a centralized focus. I understood instinctively what I was seeing (or rather, not seeing) in their stories, but I struggled to articulate this to students. Then one day I was reading Michael Tierno’s book Aristotle's Poetics for Screenwriters. In it, he talks about the concept of the Action-Idea, and that's when I knew that I'd found what I'd been searching for—a way to communicate the concept of centralized focus in a story. Here’s how Tierno breaks the concept down.

- An Action-Idea is the story’s “mission statement."

- An Action-Idea is the foundation of the entire story.

- An Action-Idea creates emotion in the audience.

- A good novel expands an Action-Idea into a full-length story without losing the essence of the simple idea upon which it is based.

- Action is the Idea of the story.

- Action is more important than characters (when building a novel's foundation).

- The hero is whoever takes the lead in the story's action.

Example: jaws is a story about a man trying to stop a killer shark. Sheriff Brody is the hero.

The idea for jaws is an action upon which the entire story is based: trying to stop a killer shark. The sheriff is responsible for protecting his community, but he faces a threat that none of his training or experience has prepared him for. That's the emotional element of the Action-Idea at the core of jaws. A lot of writers dislike approaching plot too mechanically. They'd rather let their stories grow organically. And some writers think plot is a dirty word. But play around with the concept of the Action-Idea. See if you can write the Action-Idea for your next story or novel as a single sentence, and then use that sentence to grow your story from. You might discover that your work has a stronger centralized focus.

Inciting incident. 

The inciting incident is an episode, plot point or event that hooks the reader into the story. This particular moment is when an event thrusts the protagonist into the main action of the story. Beginner's stories (short ones and novel-length ones) often take way too long to get started. The writing begins pages or even chapters before the actual story finally starts, and when it does start, it's often not clear that it is starting or just what it is. Employing the concept of inciting incident can give your story a much stronger, clearer beginning.

- The inciting incident happens in the first act (the sooner, the better).

- The inciting incident happens to the protagonist.

- The protagonist is usually passive at this juncture; the inciting incident is generally set in motion by someone or something else.

- The inciting incident is when the character’s situation changes—for the worse.

Classic Plot Design. 

I mention this plot design at the beginning of the chapter. Some writers like to use this pattern because it's known and comfortable, and general audiences respond to it well. Other writers find it too simplistic and mechanical. But it’s a good technique if you see your work as primarily being entertainment. Here's how it works:

- Begin with a character who has a goal.

- The goal can be intrinsic to the character (internal) or imposed on the character (outer).

- The character takes steps to reach the goal.

- The character encounters obstacles on their way to reaching the goal (Rising Action).

- Obstacles force the character to work harder to meet the goal.

- Obstacles get worse; the character works even harder to overcome them.

- At the climax of the story, the character either . . .


- Achieves the goal completely.

- Fails completely.

- Succeeds or fails partially.

- Succeeds or fails in an unexpected way.

- Denouement or Falling Action. (This is where the final loose ends of a story are tied up.)

As I said earlier, some writers find this technique to be limiting, resulting in fiction that's too predictable. If you've never used Classic Plot Design before, though, give it a shot and see how it works for you. The first few times you use it, you can be very methodical and outline every story beat, but eventually you'll internalize the pattern and find your own way to use it. Hopefully, it won't feel so mechanical to you then.

Plotting using Scene and Sequel. 

When I was in my late twenties, I started going to cons. The first one I went to was Context in Columbus, Ohio, where I was living at the time. I went to every panel I could and listened to the different authors speak on whatever topic the panel was focused on. I learned a ton during that con, but one of the things I noticed was that a lot of the writers kept recommending a book called Techniques of the Selling Writer by Dwight V. Swain. They said that was the book that truly taught them to write fiction, giving them the techniques they needed to begin selling their fiction regularly to publishers. So when the con was over, I hurried to a local bookstore (there was no Amazon to buy books from yet) and found a copy. The writers at the con mentioned a specific technique Swain discusses in the book called Scene and Sequel. I'd never heard of it before, but as I read Swain’s book, I realized that Scene and Sequel was a technique that allowed writers to create tight, focused fiction. You can approach this technique mechanically, plotting out your stories step by step, but you can also employ this technique instinctively, especially after you've been using it for a while. I sometimes refer to this technique as being the keys to the kingdom if you want to write popular fiction of any kind. It really can make the difference between work that’s publishable and work that isn't. Or, for indie writers, work readers read and enjoy so much they'll buy your next book. One thing about Scene and Sequel. I didn't develop the technique or name it. If I had, I'd have tried to come up with different terms. As it is, you need to view Scene and Sequel differently than the way we usually use these terms in writing. (Hopefully, this will make more sense as we go.) Here's how Scene and Sequel works: Scene: This is when a character works toward achieving a sub-goal with an outcome that furthers the plot. Example:

- Background: Bob's main goal for an entire story is to win back his ex-wife. His sub-goal (or his first step, if you like) is to convince her to have dinner with him.

- Scene: Bob’s ex won’t return his calls or texts (we can't make it too easy on him), so he visits her at the office where she works— and where she's the boss—to ask her to dinner. She resists at first (again, we can't make things easy on poor Bob), so he’s forced to embarrass her in front of the other employees somehow, maybe by relating an incident from their marriage that would make her look foolish to the people she manages.

- She agrees to go, but now she's mad at Bob (again, we can't make things easy on him). Not exactly the most romantic of starts.

- A Sequel is a story unit. It's often short and written as part of another main story unit where a character processes what has occurred and plans the next move. (Bob wouldn't do this at the office. He'd do this some time after he left, hence why this Sequel wouldn’t be part of the story unit set at the office.)

- Sequel: Bob knows his ex-wife is mad at him. He ponders what to do—or better yet, discusses the issue with a friend—and decides to convince his ex to go for a walk after dinner. He'll take her by the apartment house where they first lived after they were married in the hope that it will rekindle some fond memories from the early days of their marriage.

- The Sequel leads directly into a new Scene. And since you know the next important story unit is the after-dinner walk, you can actually skip showing the dinner. You can begin the next scene with Bob and his ex on the sidewalk, walking and talking.

- Scene: Bob does convince his ex-wife to go for walk. She's glad dinner went well, and she thinks that maybe she and Bob can be friends after all (which isn't exactly the result Bob wanted. Again, we need to keep making things hard on him all the time). They walk by the spot where their old apartment house was, but when they get there, they find that it burned down years ago. The ex is convinced that it's an omen (their relationship is forever doomed), and Bob must now come up with a new tactic in his quest to win her back. Scenes and Sequels can form an unbroken, tight chain that shapes your story. Sequels can be deferred until later in a story if necessary. For example, in the marketplace scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones is so busy fighting and running to have time to process everything that occurs in this scene. (We'll discuss how to use Scene and Sequel to write action scenes in Chapter Eighteen: “Let Them Fight!"). So later, after all the action is over, Indy and his friends can discuss the various developments that occurred in the marketplace scene (dealing with several Sequels at once) and then plan their next move.

The Amazing Story Spiral. 

Throughout my years teaching creative writing, I've searched for techniques I can offer to help nonlinear plotters create their stories. I often show the movie Wander Boys in class as an example of a character-based plot that doesn't follow Classic Plot Design. Usually we watch the film and discuss how the various elements blend together, but one time after showing the movie in class, I was struggling to articulate a metaphor for how such stories were created, and I had—check this out, literary writers—an epiphany. In my mind, I saw a wheel with multiple spokes coming from a central hub, or more accurately, spokes which were leading TO a central hub. These spokes were different plot elements, the hub was the climax or ending point of a story, and the main character was represented by a spiral line which started on the outside of the wheel and continued circling toward the hub, touching the different spokes at various points along the way, and at each point the character engaged with the spoke in a different way that moved that section of the story forward. And thus the Amazing Story Spiral was born!
To create a Story Spiral, draw a circle in the middle of a piece of paper (or in the middle of your computer screen if you're using a drawing program of some sort). This is the climax or the end point of your story. Then decide on various main story elements and draw a line coming from the middle circle for each of those elements. Then, starting at the top of the circle, draw a spiral line representing your main character (MC) which progresses through the spokes, curving ever inward in a spiral until it reaches the middle circle. Then go through the spiral and pick points where your character intersects each spoke and decide what event/story/character development will take place at that point. You can write notes about those events on the spiral itself, or if you don't have room, on another piece of paper or Word document. When you're finished, you have an alternative outline you can use as you draft your story.

I realized this pattern could work well to help nonlinear writers-and writers looking to break away from Classic Plot Design— so I introduced it to my students and we spent a class using the Story Spiral as a plotting exercise. Here are some of the things they discovered about the technique: You don't have to have your character progress through the spokes in lockstep fashion. Just because the spiral touches a spoke doesn’t mean you need to create a scene for that spoke right then. For example, in Jaws one of the story spokes would be the sheriff ’s conflict with the mayor over closing the beach because of the shark attacks. Since this isn't as important a story element as other spokes, the sheriff character only touches that spoke a couple times. Whereas, in jaws, the sheriff is going to intersect the spoke representing the shark many times.
Spokes can end before they reach the hub, or the climax of the story. Some plot elements are resolved before the story's end. For example, if one of the spokes represents a supporting character, and that character dies halfway through the story, that character’s spoke ends. You can create different spirals for different characters/viewpoints. You can use the same spokes, but the different characters will intersect them at different times and in different ways. (Using multiple spirals could be useful in plotting a novel.) You can use a Spiral to plot out a whole story, a chapter, or even a scene. The tightening of the spiral mirrors the rising action of Classic Plot Design, but it implies a sense that opposing forces are drawing closer and closer to the main character, which more accurately depicts how a character feels as the events of the story draw near a climax. So if Classic Plot Design hasn't worked for you, or if you simply would like to try an alternative plotting tool, give the Amazing
Story Spiral a try. Don't save the best for last. Many beginning horror authors end their stories with a culminating image. It's like the hoary old urban legend of The Hook. “And there, hanging from the car door handle, was the murderer’s hook hand!” (And all the seven-year-olds around the campfire shriek.) But one way to make your plots more original, and open up new directions for them, is to begin with a strong image/concept and build from there. Clive Barker's “The Body Politic“ is an excellent example of this. How many horror stories and movies have centered on the idea of the severed hand with a life of its own? Too many, and they usually end with the severed hand attacking someone in the name of vengeance. But Barker's story begins with the premise that hands—all hands: yours, mine, everyone else’s—have minds of their own, and they wish to be free of “the tyranny of the body.” All they need is a messiah to arise and lead them. My own story “Long Way Home" resulted when I drafted a tale that ended with the image of a rain of blood falling from the sky. I finished that story, but I decided to try using the image of blood rain a different way. I started another story, only this time, I began with the blood rain beginning to fall and continued from there to detail a demonic invasion and one mother's desperate attempts to protect her child. The second story was far superior to the first, and all because I finally remembered to take my own damn advice. (Don't get me wrong; I sold the first version, too. I just like “Long Way Home" better.) 

Use established story situations. 

The most common pattern—or story situation—in horror is Predator vs. Prey. A Bad Thing wants to kill/eat/possess/drive mad/transform, etc. a victim. It could very well be the first horror story pattern, the one our distant ancestors used when they told tales of friends and family who'd been caught and eaten by long-tooths. The second most common pattern is probably Investigation. The Bad Thing is at the center of a mystery, and the main character serves as an amateur detective, uncovering clues that may help him or her combat the darkness. There are a couple other common patterns in horror stories, and while there's nothing wrong with any of them, you don't want to keep repeating the same story patterns over and over in your fiction. Following is a short list of different situations that you can use to create your stories to keep them from falling into the same old horror ruts. You can also use more than one situation, especially in longer works like a novella or a novel. A more complete list of story situations appears in Appendix B at the back of this book.

- Chase

- Love

- Rescue

- Revenge

- Coming of age

- Discovery

- Quest for object

- Quest for truth

- Survival

- Escape

- Defense/protection

Techniques to complicate your plot. As I said earlier in the example about Bob, you never want to make things easy on your characters. Too many beginning writers plot their stories in a linear fashion. The character has a goal, the character successfully deals with obstacles on the way to obtaining that goal, the character succeeds, The End. The story proceeds in a straight line, and while the protagonist has obstacles to overcome, he or she always does so and the plot continues moving ever forward until it reaches its destination. But you can make your plots much more interesting by using some of the following complications. Have your characters work at cross purposes. Even if they share the same overall goal, they might have very different ideas how to go about achieving it. They also might have different agendas and at some point be working against one another. Too many stories from beginners have characters who all like each other, get along well, and cooperate easily throughout the course of the tale. Doing that will result in a dull, dry, lifeless story. Make things harder for your characters and you make the story more interesting for your readers.

Create Greater and varied obstacles. 

This technique is especially handy when plotting novels. If your characters are facing genetically engineered monsters, don't have them deal just with the beasties. Maybe the lab is located in a country with an unstable political situation and a coup occurs. Maybe both the new government and representatives of the old one want to get hold of the monsters for their own purposes. Maybe the monsters also carry a disease that could wipe out all life on Earth if they escape. Maybe one of the scientists who created the monsters is showing early signs of dementia, further complicating things. Maybe there's an earthquake, a flood, a series of Old Testament plagues . . . Whatever makes things harder for your characters is good. (Maybe not for them but for your readers.)

Reversal of fortune. 

I mentioned Raiders of the Lost Ark before. Indiana Jones is a perfect example of this technique in action. He has the greatest luck of any action-hero that's ever existed, coupled with the worst luck of any action—hero that's ever existed. His fortunes reverse as easily and often as the wind changes directions. As soon as he finds the Ark, Belloch and the Nazis take it from him. He succeeds in bringing the Ark to America, and instead of studying this incredibly powerful archeological find, the government hides it away in a vast warehouse. In a less cartoony story, you'd only have your characters experience a reversal of fortune—especially a big one-once or twice during the course of the tale. Otherwise, it's not believable.

Have a twist in the middle. 

I mentioned this technique in Chapter Eight: "Done to Death." Instead of having a plot twist at the end, where it can't do much to alter the course of the story, put your twist in the middle, where it can spin your story off into a surprising new direction. 

Sidetracks. 

This happens in quest fantasy all the time. Our heroes go in search of the magic sword, but somewhere along the way they're captured by hungry trolls that want to eat them. They must escape—not only to survive but so they can continue their quest. I'd say a great deal of the events that take place in an adventure story are sidetracks; otherwise, our heroes would travel straight to the Temple of the Holy Sword, grab it, then go find the Dark Lord and slay him. Sidetracks can make for effective and interesting subplots in novels, though there usually isn't room to use them in short fiction.

Wrong track. 

Beginners have their characters set out on a course of action, and it’s always the correct course. Sure, they may encounter problems along the way, but they're going the right way. But people make mistakes in real life all the time, and when we travel, we sometimes end up going the wrong way. Having your characters go the wrong way at one point in your story (whether this wrong way is a literal incorrect route of travel or a wrong way of trying to deal with a problem) can make your characters’ lives a lot harder and your audience’s reading experience so much better.

Plotting literary fiction. 

The divide between literary and genre fiction can be summed up thusly: literary fiction primarily focuses on character, while genre fiction focuses primarily on plot. Yes, I know you can think of a zillion exceptions. There are literary horror, fantasy, science fiction, and mystery stories. I'm not sure there are literary romance stories, since that genre depends heavily on specific plot elements—it must be a romance, there must be obstacles/conflicts during the course of the two main characters falling in love, and there must be a happy ending. A literary story that deals with romantic love wouldn't be considered a romance because it wouldn't use the expected tropes. The character/plot divide is a false one, and writers of all stripes would be better served not to worry about it and tell the best story they're capable of, focusing on and stressing whatever elements each particular story needs to be successful. Literary fiction focuses on character—getting to know a character, watching a character be revealed, watching a character be transformed in some small but profound way. Despite this focus, literary fiction tends toward emotional restraint and intellectual distance. It's a paradox. Literary fiction deals with the emotional life of humans but does so at arm's length. I sometimes wonder if that’s because it's written by intellectuals who struggle to understand their emotional sides. At times it almost seems as if they’re naturalists writing about animals they’re trying to understand. One quote I've heard about literary fiction (I can't remember the sources): “Literary fiction is about ordinary things happening to extraordinary people." (I take this to mean that the characters tend to be more intelligent and perceptive than normal; small events can move them and transform them profoundly.) A second quote: “If you want to write a literary story, write a first-person, present-tense story then cut off the beginning and ending.”
That's usually meant as a joke, but I think there’s some truth to it. Literary fiction eschews what its practitioners see as anything approaching what they view as simplistic, childish, pop-culture storytelling, and the basic linear pattern of Classic Plot Design is too formulaic for them. I think a pattern for a literary story might be better described as a spiral (as in our old friend the Amazing Story Spiral). At the center is the conflict/emotional core/theme of the story. The main character circles around this core, drawing ever closer to it bit by bit, until the character is forced to confront it. The moment of confrontation leads to an epiphany which changes the character in a profound way. This change is often not depicted “on screen” and is left up to the reader to ponder after the story is finished. Raymond Carver’s "Cathedral" is a good example of this spiral technique. If you haven't read it, google it. 

Character-centered plot. 

If the story is intended to focus on a character, then the purpose is for readers to get to know the character and gain insight into that character. Create the character first, then write detailed character notes. Look for aspects of a character's life that will show the character at his or her best and/or worst. Search for problems and crisis points. Use these problems and crisis points to develop a plot that reveals character through story action. Organizational patterns for either short stories or novels. You can allow your stories to develop organically and determine their own final shapes. But if you’re looking for specific techniques to organize a story—especially if you've fallen into a plotting rut and are looking to try something different—here are some different plotting methods you can try.

Chronological order. 

This is an obvious one, and as I said earlier, consider beginning close to the climax. Also, it's okay to skip stuff that's not important. You don't need to show your characters arguing for twenty minutes about where to go out to eat. You can just say: Jill and Sam argued for twenty minutes before finally deciding to get pizza. Or you can end a scene and begin the next one with Jill and Sam already at the restaurant eating pizza.

Flashbacks. 

These can be overused. If you're a beginning writer, I'd suggest keeping them to a bare minimum or leaving them out entirely. But one or two in a short story can be a good way to present exposition in a dramatic way instead of through dry narration.

Alternating time-frames. 

I've used. this technique a lot over the years, especially in short fiction. I'll have a present-day story that alternates with a past story featuring the same main character which provides insight into the present-day story. Sometimes the pattern will be fifty percent Present and fifty percent Past, and sometimes it’s more like seventy-five percent Present and twenty-five percent past. Whatever seems to work best. 

Snapshot technique. 

If your story covers a long time period, you can't cover every moment. So instead, choose several key moments of the story to dramatize in detail. It's like pictures in a photo album. The album might be labeled Christmas 2019, but it doesn't have pictures of every single moment of how you celebrated the holiday. There might be ten photos that, taken together, create a collage that communicates what the overall experience was like. At a guess, I'd say you might have anywhere from three to five scenes like that in a short story written in this manner. The social melodrama (or the King Pattern). In his introduction to Thomas Tessier’s collection World of Hurt and Other Selected Stories, John Langan discusses the most common basic plot structure of horror novels during the horror boom of the 1980's. Dubbed the “social melodrama" by Dale Bailey, this pattern is “a story whose large cast of characters is drawn from different socioeconomic strata, and which occurs in a naturalistic setting rendered mimetically, and which concerns a growing supernatural threat to the established social order, and which concludes with the threat vanquished and the social order reaffirmed." Some examples Langan provides are Ghost Story by Peter Straub, Swan Song by Robert McCammon, and Carrion Comfort by Dan Simmons. I'd add that most of Stephen King's output falls into this category. In fact, I'd say you could call this story structure the King Pattern because even if he didn't invent it, he's the best-known and most-influential writer in the field to use it. If you’re looking for a tried-and-true foundational genre plot for writing horror, this pattern is it. Literary writers prefer to avoid formulas like this—and many outright despise them—but readers who seek primarily to be entertained by horror respond well to it. This is no surprise. Novels in other genres such as romance, mystery, fantasy, science fiction, and thrillers have their own basic story structures that readers enjoy and never seem to get tired of. Humans respond well to patterns—it’s one of the primary ways we make sense of the world—and common shared patterns are what make a novel a genre novel. The social melodrama pattern is a conservative one. Not in a political sense, but in a traditional, safe, if-it-ain’t-broke-don't-fix-it way. Its biggest drawback is that it’s known, and I've mentioned before how once a particular story element is known in horror it can lose its effectiveness. But if you want to attempt to reach the largest audience possible, the King Pattern might work well for you.

Tips for writing a monster story. 

I've written three monsters-eating-people books—Teeth of the Sea, Blood Island (both from Severed Press), and Alien: Prototype. If you want to write a lyrical, character-centered story with deep themes that speak to what it means to be a human being struggling to make sense of life in the twenty-first century . . . a monster story probably isn’t the best way to go. But if you’d like to write about people getting eaten by big things with sharp teeth, I've got you covered! (And I'd argue that any story with a Bad Thing—monster, human, or supernatural force—that serves the function as predator in any way can benefit from using the techniques in this section.) Here are some tips for writing good monster stories: A monster is only a monster when someone perceives it as a monster. Imagine a monster wandering around in a field by itself. It's not a monster. It's just a creature hanging out, not bothering anybody. It only becomes a monster when a human is there to perceive it as such. It's characters who make a monster a monster. Without them, without how they react to the monster, there's no story. Alternately, imagine a tornado. If one appears and moves across a desolate plain, never encountering humans, animals, or damaging any property, it's a non-event. A tornado is only a disaster when it impacts people. How people react to the disaster is the story, not the disaster itself. Same deal with monsters. Remember Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth? At the end, he tells the main character, Sarah, that he’s exhausted from living up to her expectations of him. She needed a villain for her journey, and Jareth played that role for her. It's a very meta moment, but it speaks to a truth about writing stories. Villains (threats, problems, conflict, even mundane troubles as in non-genre fiction) exist to give your characters something to do. The conflict is the motivating force in a story. 

Use a large cast. 

If you have only two characters in your story—and it's a novel—your monster probably won't get to do very much during the course of the tale. Monsters need people to kill (or possess, or transform into monsters, etc.). You need a number of characters whose ultimate function is to up the body count and increase the suspense and the stakes for your heroes as the story progresses. But as I've said before, you still need to respect all of your characters, even if they are basically sacrificial lambs. To that end. . . 

Give the humans—even the ones who are going to get eaten—character arcs (if only small ones) separate from dealing with the monster. 

Your characters are busy living their lives when the monster comes along to interrupt (and possibly end) those lives. Maybe the characters can't continue to deal with their own problems and try to reach their goals while trying to survive a monster encounter, but that doesn't mean their problems leave their minds. And their problems may have an impact on how they respond to the monster—especially if they have problems with others who are also dealing with the monster. An excellent example of this, which I mentioned in a previous chapter, is Stephen King's story “Lunch at the Gotham Cafe." Giving each character—even the ones who are only on stage for a short time before getting killed during their time in the spotlight—grants them a measure of dignity. They aren't just nameless, faceless nobodies whose only purpose is to die. They are, if only for a brief moment in your story, real people who are going to experience real loss—maybe even the ultimate loss. It’s important how your characters react to the monster, but it's just as important that we understand who they are and what the monster is going to take from them, as well as the impact that loss will have on others. 

Give characters different reactions to your monster. 

If all your characters react the same way to your monster, your story will be boring and repetitive. Each character should react in a way that's specific to their personality. Remember what I said in an earlier chapter about creating characters? The most important thing to know about them is how they respond to conflict, problems, danger, stress, setbacks, failure—their responses tell you what they will do in any given situation, and that, in turn, gives your story its shape. Give your characters different responses to your monster, and you'll have a richer, more involving story.

Make your monster unique (or at least interesting). 

The great white in jaws isn't a normal shark. It's much bigger than normal, and its behavior is atypical. It has almost supernatural abilities. For example, it can stay submerged even though it has a number of flotation devices attached to it that should slow it down and keep it at the surface. And why does it even attack the Orca in the first place? A normal shark would be off looking for food, not responding to a challenge from a trio of men hunting it. In Deep Blue Sea, the sharks have been genetically engineered to be intelligent, and they're housed in an underwater research facility which they've caused to be flooded so they can escape to the surface. So not only are they unusual, the environment in which the humans must battle them is also unusual. In The Meg, the shark is a gigantic prehistoric version of a great white. In The Ghost and the Darkness (which I’ve mentioned before), two male lions are preying on workers building a railroad in Africa. Lions don't typically attack humans, and there are hints that nature is working through the lions to attack the forces of civilization encroaching upon it. Simply making your monster a giant—or more bloodthirsty than normal—version of a natural creature isn't enough to make your story stand out from the pack. Try to find a way to put your own unique spin on it. In Teeth of the Sea, the monsters I used were pliodons, ancient sea dinosaurs. To make the story different than the run of the mill, I set my tale on the island of Las Dagas (Spanish for the daggers, a reference to the pliodons’ teeth), where a luxury resort has been built with canals crisscrossing the island, giving my beasties greater access to my human characters. I also did a Gargo and had the main monsters be juveniles while their parents, who remained offshore, were much larger. In Blood Island, I created the Mass: a prehistoric creature formed of living blood cells that uses other animals—in this case bull sharks—as puppets to catch food which the Mass absorbs. And when the Mass absorbs a human with a strong personality, her brain melds with the Mass, giving it intelligence, making the creature far more dangerous. In Alien: Prototype, my Xenomorph is born from a human host that was once infected with a deadly disease. The Xenomorph incorporates this disease into its genetic makeup and becomes a very different kind of monster than a usual specimen of its kind.

Give the monster its own arc. 

In Teeth of the Sea, the pliodons return to Las Dagas every decade to mate and lay eggs. There are two mated pairs, which, along with the two larger pliodons offshore, form a single pod. There’s a struggle for dominance in the pod as the story progresses. And of course, the pliodons have to deal with the pesky (but delicious) humans that have built a resort on their spawning grounds since the last time they were there. In Blood Island, a movie crew is filming a low-budget monster movie in a small Texas coastal town. The human the Mass absorbs is the film's cynical producer. The Mass now not only has intelligence to draw on, it has imagination, and it decides to make a real-life monster "movie," using the cast and crew as well as the town's citizens as victims. In Alien: Prototype, my Xenomorph has two simple but intertwined goals: to reproduce and create others of its kind, and to spread the disease it now carries. Give your monsters their own story, even if it's a basic one, that goes beyond “Get in my belly, soft-skin!” 

Write some scenes from the monster’s point of view. 

Presenting some scenes from the monster’s viewpoint is a good way to build suspense. You can let readers know what your monster is doing when the characters are completely clueless. That way, readers can anticipate the slaughter to come. In both Teeth of the Sea and Alien: Prototype, the monsters aren’t intelligent or even all that self-aware, so when I wrote scenes from their point of view, I used an omniscient third person viewpoint, and instead of focusing on what my monsters were thinking (since they didn't think) I focused on what they did, on what stimuli prompted them to act (smells, sounds, sights), and on what instincts drove them to certain actions. I also did this for the first part of Blood Island, but once the Mass became sentient, I could write about it with a close third-person point of view. 

Try to make your plot more complex and surprising than “Monster eats a lot of people and then is defeated by surviving humans." 

Sure, your basic underlying plot may be exactly that, but you need to dress it up and make it seem different than other similar stories. In a lot of ways, monsters—eating-people stories are like romance novels. There‘s a basic underlying plot—two people meet, fall in love, etc.—but you can tell a million different stories using this basic plot as a spine for your story, and you can do the same thing with a monsters-eating-people tale. Different characters in different situations, in different settings, facing different monsters, and encountering different additional challenges. For example, a hurricane blows in while the monster is attacking, or one of the characters will die if he or she doesn't get medical treatment, and so the other characters have to defeat the monster to save their friend’s life. Also, when you're plotting your story, don’t go with a clichéd idea (this is true no matter what kind of story you're writing). Ask yourself what couldn't possibly happen in your story at this moment, and then make it happen. Maybe the character that needs medical attention is faking it for some reason, and the others risk their lives to get him or her to a hospital without realizing until too late that they've been tricked. If your plot surprises you—even if it rests on a familiar spine—it will surprise your readers, too.

Less is more with a monster. 

Horror—even action-adventure horror—depends on a sense of the unknown. The more you show your monster during your story—the more known it becomes—the less impact it will have. Don't wait until the last few pages of your novel to reveal your monster, though. That's a good way to get hate e-mail from readers! Try to spread out your monster‘s appearances, and try to vary them, making some appearances short and some longer. Save the longer ones for pivotal points in the story, and use the shorter ones to foreshadow events and increase suspense. You want your readers to crave more of your monster, not get bored and think, When the hell are these people finally going ta kill this damn thing? If you're not sure how to do this, pick several monster-eating-people books or films you like and analyze them to determine how much “stage time" the monster gets compared to the total length of the book or film. This will give you an idea of how many monster scenes to write in your story. 

Monsters stories should be like monster movies—fast-paced, full of action, and fun. 

Monster stories are effective on a primal level because they're the most common (and simple) type of horror story: predator hunts prey. They already strike a profound chord in humans. They don‘t need to be serious for them to be effective (look at the Tremors series of films.) And really, they're silly stories. Childhood demons come to life. The Boogeyman (wearing a shark or giant lizard suit) is coming to get you! People read these stories and watch these films for childlike (not childish) fun, and a fast-paced story with action is exactly what they're looking for. That doesn't mean you have to give it to them, of course. There's plenty of room for slower-paced, atmospheric, somber monster tales. Adam Nevil‘s novel The Ritual is a good example, as is the movie The Last Winter. I love both of them, but they don't give me the same childlike glee as when I watch a Godzilla film. Write the kind of monster story you want, but if you want people to have a blast while reading your story, I suggest leaning into the pulpier aspects of the genre and having a good time yourself. The fun you had writing your story will be passed on to your readers. 

Remember, people are getting killed, injured, and traumatized in your story. 

No matter how much fun your monster story is, regardless of whether it’s light as a souffle or filled with pitch-black humor, people get hurt in these stories. They experience physical and emotional pain. They may die, leaving behind grief-stricken survivors, and those selfsame survivors might experience long-term trauma. You don't need to wallow in the realities of what monster carnage would truly be like, but you don't want to dismiss those realities altogether, either. It can be a fine balancing act, but it's an important one, I think, and for all good horror fiction, not just monster stories. Treating violence, emotional trauma, and death seriously also raises the threat-level for your characters, increases the stakes for them, and amps up the suspense for your readers. Violence is a storytelling tool, but I think it's one that we should wield like a scalpel—carefully and with intent—rather than like a sledgehammer, just bashing away for the hell of it. 

Hopefully, I've given you some things to think about when writing your next monster tale. And if you’ve never tried to write one before, go for it. They’re a hell of a lot of fun!

What's the best advice you can give to a beginning writer of horror/dark fantasy/suspense?

Joe Hill, bestselling author of Full Throttle

1.

Good horror is, perhaps counter-intuitively, about empathy. When horror succeeds, it's because the writer gave us a character to root for, to invest in, and to love. Then, when that character is faced with the worst—the fatal infection, the man with the mask made of human skin—we're rooting for her to somehow impossibly defy her fate and survive. To make it through.  Without a character to care about, horror often devolves into bloody slapstick: the Three Stooges with flying entrails. That can be entertaining too, but it's not horror as I understand it.

Any suggestions I might make about craft aren't very genre specific. I try to get my characters talking, so I can find out who they are and what they want. I often write pages of dialogue in first draft that never make it into the final book. I write that stuff for me, looking for someone to give a damn about, someone who might be interesting to hang out with for another 30 or 40 or 400 pages. The other thing, I never sit down to write a book, or a comic, or a short story. That’s too overwhelming. When I dig into a day of work, I'm just looking to write one good scene. Or I think even smaller: I get focused on writing one decent sentence, the shorter the better. Many a good day of work has started with a deathless line like: “Insects hummed."

Gaby Triana, author of the Haunted Florida series

Good horror begins with compelling characters rather than a scary situation, since fear is a subjective experience. Once you know these characters inside and out, what makes them tick, what shadow sides they're unable or unwilling to face, then the rest of the story basically writes itself, as it unfolds directly from those fears. Also, I like my horror atmospheric and moody, with lots of classic elements: ghosts, candles that snuff out by themselves, dusty bookshelves, and staircases. Lots of staircases.

2. 

Know your monsters. Don't try to write another author's monsters. The audience that enjoys your particular brand of weirdness, gothic-ness, or love of Victorian cryptids will find you. When that happens, you become effective just by finding your tribe, and isn't that what good writing is about, creating a special connection with readers that's unique? 

Michael Knost, award-winning author of Return of the Mothman

1. 

I think it's the human element. Without the human element, the monster—or the horrific aspects of the story—are mere props in a timeline. It's all about eliciting an emotional response from the character, which will hopefully elicit an emotional response from the reader. Merriam-Webster defines horror as “painful and intense fear, dread, or dismay.” It has nothing to do with the size of the teeth or claws—it has everything to do with the depth of the character.

2. 

Keeping in line with my response to what makes good horror, I think the best advice for horror writers would be to focus more on developing characters rather than developing monsters or horrific elements. Remember, the more layers we know about the character, whether the layers be weaknesses, struggles, or issues, the better we can customize the very elements that we hope will elicit an emotional response with fear or dread or dismay.

Lee Thomas, two-time Lambda Literary Award-winning and Bram Stoker Award-winning author

1. 

In the broadest sense, it's the offspring of normalcy and wonder. Something wondrous penetrates the "normal" world, and often enough that wonder is comprised of a dark origin or intent. It wraps itself around characters that engage us, and we experience a sense of dread through the connection we feel for those characters.

2.

Take time to develop your characters. Make their reactions and choices feel authentic. An imaginative and otherwise great story can be completely derailed by dull characters, or characters behaving illogically. It's always about the characters for me, because ghosts can haunt a house for centuries, vampires can fill the sky, and zombies can shamble from desert to glacier, but it's only when these creatures go after strong characters that true horror emerges.

CHAPTER FIPTEEN

THE DARK HEART OF HORROR

Aspiring writers are forever searching for The Secret: the single trick or technique that will elevate their writing from promising to publishable. Old pros say there is no secret to getting published, that it's simply the result of hard work—reading a lot, writing a lot, getting feedback on your work, learning how to market your work, etc.—and I wouldn’t dispute that. But there is one element missing all too often from beginners’ fiction. I'd argue that it’s one of the most important aspects of creating successful, compelling stories, and it's as close to The Secret as anyone is likely to get: writing with an emotional core. Successful stories should entertain, stimulate the imagination, and provide an artistic experience, but they also need to move readers emotionally. At the heart of a story—and there's a reason we call it the heart—should lie a strong emotional core. It is, in a very real sense, what a story is ultimately about. For example, on the surface the movie Back to the Future appears to be about a teenager who goes back in time and prevents his parents‘ meeting, thereby endangering his own existence. He needs to get his parents together, save himself, and then return to his own time. That’s the premise and basic plot of the film. But the emotional core of the film—why it moves audiences is Marty McFly‘s relationship with his parents and with Doc Brown. He gets to know his parents as teenagers like himself, gaining a new perspective on them. He feels connected to them as a family despite the gulf in years, and because he loves them, he can't stop himself from trying to make their lives better in the past, even at the risk of altering the future in potentially disastrous ways. It's the same for Doc. Marty loves him, and he can't stand the idea of Doc getting killed in the future, so he tries to prevent it, despite Doc's wishes. Simply put, the emotional core of the movie is love of family. Without this core, the movie might’ve been a fun adventure, but it wouldn't be the much-loved classic it is today. The emotional core is what connects an audience to a story; it's what makes a story matter to them. Here are some things to think about in order to strengthen the emotional core in your stories. What is the main emotional relationship/connection between characters in the story? In Silence of the Lambs, the main emotional relationship is between Hannibal Lector and Clarice Starling, between predator and potential prey or, if you prefer, between wild animal and hunter. Starling wants to use Lector to catch another killer, and Lector wants to use Starling to amuse himself and escape confinement. But the power dynamic between the two constantly shifts, and it's unclear to the audience, as well as to the characters themselves, how they feel about each other and their roles. This ever-shifting unease-will Starling remain uncorrupted by Lector? can Starling's inherent goodness, if not redeem him, reveal that he at least possesses some small measure of humanity?-is the true mystery that powers the story. And just like Back to the Future, it's the emotional core that makes this story a classic, elevating it above a run-of-the-mill thriller. So consider the characters in your story and decide what connects them. This doesn't mean they have to have a positive relationship. Ahab’s relationship to Moby Dick isn't exactly warm and fuzzy. Once you firm up the emotional relationship between the characters4once you've created a strong emotional core—then you can use that relationship as a foundation upon which the rest of your story rests. Or perhaps more accurately, as the seed from which your story will grow. How is the emotional core reflected in the plot? In jaws, the emotional core is Sheriff Brody’s need to protect the people in his community. This creates conflict in the story because while Brody wants to keep people from being eaten by the shark, he always has a duty to protect the town's economy, and the town depends on the money the summer people pump into it every year. If Brody closes the beaches, he kills the town. If he doesn't close the beaches, more people will die. Brody is trapped in an impossible situation. He cannot protect everyone in every way. He must choose. (Just to be clear, this economic aspect of the story is more prevalent in the novel than in the film.)
In my novel The Mouth of the Dark, a middle-aged man's twenty-year-old daughter is missing. The emotional core comes from his need to find her because he believes he's failed her too many times in the past, and he‘s determined not to fail her again—no matter what. Everything in the plot revolves around this need, and the character does things he would ordinarily never think of doing in order to find his daughter. In acting, this is called motivation, but when it comes to creating a story, the emotional core doesn’t just motivate your character, it motivates the story’s events as well. Write the emotional core of your story at the top of a piece of paper or Word document and list all the ways the core could be expressed in terms of plot events. If you have a plot event that doesn't relate somehow to the core—especially for a short story—don't include it when drafting. How is the emotional core reflected in the setting? In both Moby Dick and jaws, the sea is the most important part of the setting. Ahab wants revenge and Brody wants to protect his town, but both of those motivations lead these characters to try to control the object of their respective hunts. But the sea is uncontrollable. It's wild and dangerous, and it conceals rather than reveals. Struggling against it during the hunt will test each man and show what lengths he will go to, and what he’s willing to sacrifice, to find and kill his quarry. In The Wizard of Oz, the land of Oz appears on the surface to be a beautiful, magical world, a place a little girl (in the book) or a young woman (in the film) would love to remain in forever—especially when she compares it to life in boring Dust Bowl-era Kansas. But Oz is a confusing, dangerous place of Wicked Witches, deceitful (if ultimately kind-hearted) wizards, Tin Woodsmen created by mechanically replacing the lost body parts of a human man (read the book), creepy-as-hell flying monkeys, and other bizarre elements. It's no wonder that Dorothy ultimately decides that the emotional core of the story—There’s no place like home—is a better choice than remaining in a beautiful but chaotic magical land. Again, write down your emotional core and list all the ways your setting can reflect that core. Is the emotional core of your story Isolation? Think of all the ways your characters could be isolated, both the obvious and not-so-obvious ways. Is the emotional core of your story Sticking by a Friend No Matter What? Think of all the ways your protagonist could be challenged by the setting to continue sticking by his or her friend. For example, two characters are lost in the wilderness and one has a broken leg. What would make it difficult—maybe almost impossible—for the uninjured friend to remain with the injured one, despite his or her resolve to do so? Lack of food and water? Weather? Wolves? How is the emotional core reflected in the theme? First, a word about theme. Some writers make conscious decisions about theme while others don’t worry about it. If a theme happens to emerge while they’re writing, great. If not, no big deal. The important thing is to tell the story as well as you can. But I'd argue that an emotional core is the theme, at least with a little tweaking. Ahab wants revenge against Moby Dick, but he can never get revenge. The whale has no idea he hurt Ahab and nothing Ahab could do to him, including killing him, would ever make the whale sorry for what he did. Nor would it ever make him realize that Ahab was the one who killed him. So Ahab can never have the revenge he seeks, and thus the theme: Revenge is ultimately impossible and only leads to self-destruction. In Back to the Future, Marty's love for Doc and his family leads to that story's theme: Family connections transcend Time, and these connections define us, bind us, and in the end, might even save us. Thinking about how the emotional core of your story can grow into a theme allows you to return to the story-to the characters, the plot, the setting—and strengthen the theme, making your story tighter, more focused, and ultimately more impactful for the audience.
How does the emotional core serve as a counterpoint to the plot and setting, and vice versa? The emotional core, plot, and setting don’t have to complement each other. They can serve as counterpoints. A simple example would be a scene depicting a graveside funeral service. The emotional core is sorrow. The clichéd impact of the emotional core on the setting: a gloomy, rainy day. Counterpoint: a sunny day that seems at odds with the emotions the characters are feeling, or a pleasant but bland day weather-wise, as if nothing important is happening when, for the family, something extremely important is taking place: saying a final farewell to their loved one. By playing against the emotional core with the setting, you can actually intensify it. In the movie Poltergeist, the emotional core is the fear that your family isn't safe even in their own home. Once the paranormal events in the house increase to a certain point, the family wants to get the hell out of there. The fear should drive them out, but little Carol Anne becomes trapped in a dark dimension adjacent to our world, a dimension only accessible through the house, so the parents must stay. (They're good parents, though, so they send Carol Anne's older sister away rather than risk losing her, too.) Plot- wise, the characters are forced to do the opposite of what they want to do, what the story's emotional core is driving them to do, It's the plotting power of emotional core counterpoint at its finest. Each scene can have its own emotional core. So far, I've been talking about emotional cores that serve as the center of entire stories. But each scene can have its own emotional core, one that may or may not be strongly tied into the overall emotional core. The example of the funeral service I used above can also serve as an example here. Sorrow might be the emotional core of such a scene, while struggling to maintain a marriage in the face of tragedy—such as the loss of a child—might be the overarching emotional core for the whole story. Adding emotional cores to your scenes will make each one of them have an impact on your audience, and they'll build one upon the other, increasing people's emotional investment in your story as it progresses toward its climax.
Emotional cores in short stories versus long stories. Short stories need to be tighter and more focused than novels. (Tell us something we don't know, Tim!) Because of this, you'll likely have an important emotional relationship between two characters and no more. There simply isn't room to develop multiple expressions of the emotional core in a short story. So if your short story is about an elderly man mourning the death of his beloved dog—a man who can connect with animals but who has trouble connecting with people—you won't show multiple people trying to console him and reach out to him emotionally, as you could do in a novel. You'll have only one person fulfill this role. His estranged son. The widow who lives down the street. A neighbor he's never gotten along with but who understands the grief over losing a pet. Two main characters, one emotional core. That's about all a short story can handle.
A novel, however, is a different matter. If you want to write a novel about the elderly man who’s lost his dog, you can have all of the above characters be a part of it, and you can explore the emotional core on multiple levels and in multiple ways. Some writers claim that there are short story ideas and there are novel ideas, and the two aren't interchangeable. While there might be some truth to this, you can often turn a short story idea into a novel idea—and the other way around—by expanding or narrowing the emotional core. By doing so, I could write about the elderly man at any length and complexity—and so could you. Which should come first when drafting? The character, the plot, or the emotional core? Short answer: It doesn't matter so long as everything is in its place when the story is finished and ready to submit to an editor. I suggest starting wherever you feel the most creative energy and potential with a given story. If you're really into the characters, start with them first. If you have an awesome idea for a story, but you're not sure of anything else, work out the idea in detail and add other elements later. If you're a planner, make decisions about your story's emotional core before you begin drafting. If you prefer to write by the seat of your pants, start writing and work on firming up the emotional core in revisions. How you tend to the emotional core doesn't matter. I'd argue that since the emotional core serves as a foundation for your story, the sooner you tend to it, the better, but the most important thing is that you do tend to it before you type The End. Regardless of what kind of fiction you write—entertainment-focused, literary, genre-oriented, experimental, or some blend of these—make sure to write it with a strong emotional core. By doing so you'll not only produce stories that readers will love, but stories they'll remember long after they finish reading. Stories that change them, that make a difference in their lives. Stories that matter. And in the end, aren't those the kind of stories we all want to read and write?

What's the best advice you can give to a beginning writer of horror/dark fantasy/suspense?

Lucy Taylor, award-winning author of Spree and Other Stories

1. 

For me, good horror blends so seamlessly into normal life that by the time it fully reveals itself, the reader feels “Yes, this is how it would be. This could happen to anyone, even to me!" In other words, it's portraying horror not as something external, but also internal in a disturbingly intimate way. It’s not just glimpsing the demon in someone else’s eyes, but sensing its proximity everywhere—in the beat of your blood, in your bones, in your soul.

2. 

I’d say it's important to explore your own private fears, hatreds, perversions, and lusts with unflinching courage and non-judgmental curiosity. Search around in your mind's dark attic where you store what no one else is supposed to see and you may not even know about yourself. Use what you find. Never turn away from the horror residing within you, because it's from there your fiction will burst forth, perhaps ripping out a little piece of you with it. 

Hunter Shea, author of Slash

1. 

Over the past five decades, I’ve seen and read it all—the good, the bad and the fugly. It used to be that I enjoyed it all, too, but I've gotten a bit pickier over the years. Good horror in fiction needs rounded, sympathetic characters. It's not about the ghost or the monster or the killer. Well, not just about them. You need someone your readers can root for or against. If you can't feel them as a character, you can't feel their fear. Look, it's easy to write scenes of carnage and gore. What makes good horror stand out from the rest is how the characters draw you in. You want to run alongside them, share their success when they turn the table on the killer or feel their pain when they zigged when they should have zagged. Good horror takes chances. It drags something new from the dark into the light. Good horror finds an angle on an old trope you’d never considered before. Most of all, it hits you right in the emotions, a real sucker punch to the ol’ chakras.

2. 

Take more time developing your protagonists than your antagonist(s). What makes them uniquely strong? What are their weaknesses? Is this a chance to overcome their shortcomings or succumb to some past sin? Don't be afraid to take chances with your story. Horror is about crushing boundaries. Write something that you would want to read, not what you think others want to read. You're going to have to live with the book way longer than a person who reads it. Make sure it's something you want to share your life with for a good chunk of time. Last but not least, read a ton of horror. You’ll learn as much from the bad as you will from the good.

P.D. Cacek, award-winning author of Second Lives

1. 

I think it has to be something people can relate to, some ordinary event or smell or sound that gets turned 180-degrees. For example: most people have heard leaves rustling in the wind, but what if there is no wind and no leaves and you hear the sound outside your closed bedroom door in the middle of the night?

2. 

Read. Read what scares you and then analyze it. Why did it scare me? What was it that got me? Why am I sleeping with the lights on? And how can I do this to others?

Kathryn Ptacek, author of Looking Backward in Darkness

1.

I think the answer to that is: Whatever keeps you, the reader, turning the page, be it a paper one or a digital one. Sometimes, you might guess the ending long before reaching that point, but if you get so engrossed in the story and the characters that you have to finish the novel or story, no matter what, then that's totally successful dark writing. I also think that you have to have sympathetic characters. No one wants to read 500 or more pages about someone they hate. Well, I don't. Make us like your characters in some way, and we, as readers, will follow their journey.

2.

Best advice? Read everything in the field—old stuff, new stuff, terrible stuff, excellent stuff. Don't just read novels or stories from the last ten years. New writers need to get a thorough perspective of the field, and that includes reading everything from Victorian times on. And then don't confine yourself to reading in just the field. Read mysteries, romance, westerns, suspense, fantasy, science fiction, nonfiction. When you’re a writer, nothing you read EVER goes to waste.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

A MATTER OF STYLE

You can't talk about writing horror—or writing anything, for that matter—without talking about style (well, maybe you can, but I can't). The way a story is presented to the reader is as important as the story itself. Maybe more so. Two different writers can take the same basic idea or even the same detailed outline of a story and deliver radically different versions of it. The difference will be in how they tell it. That's style. Long, evocatively written passages filled with striking imagery. Short, staccato-like words and sentences that hit like machine-gun rounds. Lyrical stories that take their time to get where they're going, wandering off the trail whenever some pretty-shiny catches the writer's attention. Fast-paced, hard-driving narratives that surge forward at lightning speed, never giving you a chance to catch your breath. Since everything in a piece of fiction is affected by style or is a part of it, we've already discussed a lot about style in the preceding chapters (and we'll talk some more about it in the chapters after this one). I don’t want to rehash ground we've already covered—or prehash ground we've yet to talk about—so for this chapter, I thought we could discuss a few matters of style not covered elsewhere in the book (with one small exception toward the end of this chapter). First off, writing fiction on multiple levels. Multilevel fiction. Humans experience reality as a bombardment of constantly changing multiple stimuli that our conscious and subconscious minds constantly sift through in order to determine what's important—and what isn't—at any given moment, in order to tell us what we need to pay attention to and what we can ignore. Put simply, a hell of a lot is going on inside and outside us all the time. Simulating this experience in your fiction is what gives it verisimilitude—the appearance of being real. Writing multilevel fiction overlaps writing with an immersive point of view, which we've discussed before, but multilevel fiction is more about the layered structure of your story. Whenever I discuss this concept in class or a workshop, I show a PowerPoint slide with a picture of a cake that has a piece cut out. There are six or seven layers, each a different color. Each scene in your fiction should function on multiple levels at a time. Most beginners‘ fiction functions on only a couple levels (if that), but if you want to create truly effective fiction—whether your goals are literary, entertainment-focused, or somewhere in between—making sure your cake has all the right levels is vital. So let's talk about them. Each scene in a story or novel should accomplish multiple goals. Ask yourself these questions:

- What's the current action in this scene? What happens?

- What's the conflict in this scene?

- What are the character interactions in this scene?

- How is the main character developed in this scene?

- What's the emotional focus of this scene?

- How does this scene further the larger story?

- What exposition (background information) does this scene add to the story?

- How does this scene increase the suspense and deepen the mystery of the larger story?

- How do all of these elements work together to move the larger story forward? If the scene starts at Point A, where does it end up at?

Each scene you write needs to answer all of these questions. Now, not all of these layers are developed in the same detail in each scene, and some may not be possible to include. For example, your character can't interact with others if he or she is alone. The action in a scene may be very mild—say, someone going out for a cup of coffee. But during the drive, your character sees his or her abusive uncle walking down the sidewalk—an uncle who died five years ago. The emotional core of that scene is huge, as is the way it deepens the mystery of the story and furthers the overall plot. But the action? Your character is driving to the coffee shop and passes what seems to be a ghost. That's it. You can approach a technique like this a couple ways. You can consciously use it to plan a scene, making sure as many levels on the list as possible are included in some fashion, then write the scene. If you find such an approach too restrictive, write the scene -or write the entire story or novel—without worrying about the list, and then use it when you're going back through and revising. The Sweet Spot. I often find it difficult to articulate to students exactly what makes good fiction. There are stories and novels that many of us agree are good, even great. We know ‘em when we see ’em, but just because we can recognize good fiction doesn't mean we can automatically produce it, any more than we can listen to a highly talented and well-trained singer perform and then instantly sing as well ourselves. I’m always searching for new ways to express the fundamental concepts of fiction writing—both to help my students and to further my own understanding of the craft. Sometimes an insight will come to me during a class I’m teaching. But other times ideas come to me as a sudden burst of inspiration, like when Doc Brown first visualized the flux capacitor (although I've never needed to crack my head on the edge of a sink to get ideas). I came up with the idea for the Sweet Spot this way. It popped into my head as a complete Venn diagram, labels and all, and I grabbed a piece of paper and drew it. In fine absent-minded professor tradition, I quickly lost the drawing and forgot that I'd ever visualized the Sweet Spot. Months passed, and one day my wife found my hastily drawn diagram while working on our taxes. (How it got mixed up with our financial papers, I'll never know.) She held the drawing up and asked if it was something I needed. I almost didn’t look at it, figuring she must be talking about a receipt of some kind, but I looked and there it was: The Sweet Spot.

Image.

The first aspect of my vision for the Sweet Spot was to see fiction as having four primary goals: 1) To entertain, 2) to provide an aesthetic experience, 3) to evoke an emotional response, and 4) to stimulate imagination. (None of these goals is more important than any other; they're all equal despite my numbering them here.) The Sweet Spot—the area where fiction is its strongest—is the point where all four goals coincide. Let's talk about each goal and why it's important, then we'll discuss why it's vital to tend to them all—to the Sweet Spot—if you want to produce the best fiction you're capable of. A disclaimer first: Yes, it's possible to write successful, publishable fiction focusing more on one goal than the others. Popular fiction tends to focus more on entertaining, and literary fiction tends to focus more on providing an aesthetic experience. But I believe that regardless of what your ultimate writing and publishing goals are, all types of fiction are most effective when writers focus on the Sweet Spot. To entertain: Effective fiction should capture readers‘ attention and hold it throughout a story. It should repay readers’ time and attention, should give them an experience they find fulfilling. When they finish a story, they should feel satisfied that their time was well spent. Why this goal is important: If readers aren't entertained, why should they bother reading fiction at all? Different readers may find different aspects of a story entertaining—some may enjoy action more, some detailed characterization, some evocative description—but people don't read by accident. They choose to read, and they want to feel like their choice was a worthwhile one. More, they want it to be enjoyable. To provide an aesthetic experience: Effective fiction should give readers an artistic experience through skilled use of language and imagery, innovative structure, and well-drawn characters. Originality should be strived for, and plots shouldn't be predictable. Why this goal is important: Fiction is art as much as craft, and even casual readers have a need for artistic appreciation. A well-turned phrase, a chilling description, a mind-blowing plot twist, a psychologically complex character, lively dialogue that you can practically hear . . . The artistic aspects of fiction make stories live and breathe, making them more than simple recitations of This Happened, Then That Happened. To evoke an emotional response: Each story should have an emotional core and explore the emotional life of the characters in addition to whatever else may be happening. The Wizard of Oz is just an adventure without the emotional core of Dorothy wanting to go home so badly. jaws is also just an adventure without the emotional core of Sheriff Brody feeling such a strong responsibility to protect his town from the killer shark. The outcome of a story should create an emotional catharsis for the reader. Why this goal is important: Anyone can communicate basic information with writing, but it's infinitely harder to use those abstract marks called letters to make readers care about imaginary people doing imaginary things (often in imaginary places and times). When art of any kind touches the human heart, when it moves us, it reconnects us with a huge aspect of what makes us human. It cuts through our emotional barriers and deepens our empathy. In short, it makes us better people, and what could be more important than that? To stimulate imagination: Interesting ideas, vivid description, and immersive point of view all help stimulate readers‘ imaginations. Banal, run-of-the-mill ideas and plain, overly simplistic writing that reads more like a summary than a story don't. Why this goal is important: For one thing, exercising our imaginations makes us smarter. Vivid fiction allows us to take the abstract and visualize the concrete, to see, hear, taste, touch, and smell that which is not real, to compare the choices characters make to those we might make—or not—in similar situations, and in speculative fiction (science fiction, fantasy, horror, and any combination thereof) we project ourselves into the world of tomorrow, worlds that never have been, and confront nightmares safely on the page.
The Sweet Spot: As I've already said, this is the intersection where the four goals meet. Stories that hit the Sweet Spot tend to these goals equally: they entertain, provide an aesthetic experience, evoke emotion, and stimulate imagination. Stories that do this operate strongly on all levels, not just one or two, and not only are they well-made stories, they fulfill multiple needs for readers. Stories that hit the Sweet Spot are, simply, the best stories of which we're capable of producing, and that's what we should strive for every time we write, isn't it? Short stories vs. novels: The Sweet Spot works for both short and long fiction, but in long fiction, you might think of each scene or chapter as having its own Sweet Spot. For example, Chapter Three of your novel might entertain because there's an action scene. It might provide an aesthetic experience because one of the characters is blind and you're going to write the action from his or her point of view. The character is fighting a once-beloved mentor, which will evoke emotion, and you'll use intercutting brief flashbacks of that character being trained as a child by the mentor during the present-time action to stimulate imagination (and since this is a structural choice, it doubles down on the aesthetic experience). In Chapter Four, you'll have a new set of goals, and so on. So when you write: At some point during your process—when you first generate ideas, while you draft, or when you review your first draft—ask yourself these questions:

1. 

What can I do to make this story as entertaining as possible?

2. 

What can I do to provide a greater aesthetic experience?

3. 

How can I more strongly evoke emotion?

4. 

How can I better stimulate readers‘ imaginations?

Do this, hit the Sweet Spot, and you'll take your fiction to a whole new level, gain more readers, and create fiction that readers not only enjoy, but that matters to them. What more could any of us possibly hope for? 

Managing story pace. 

You want your stories to read the way a symphony sounds, sometimes slow and evocative, other times fast and exhilarating. In short, you want your fiction to have effective pace. Pace equals movement, but whether a given chapter moves fast or slow will depend on what effect you want it to have on readers. The following techniques can help you manage the pace of your chapters—provided you choose them carefully, and always with your readers in mind.

Normal Pace. 

Use Normal Pace when the story is progressing but nothing "special" is happening. This technique is good for setting a scene or creating a transition between two more dramatic scenes. Normal Pace can also give readers a break from the action and allow you to tone down the pace of your story so you can begin to build it back up again. To create Normal Pace, use an even blend of description, dialogue, narration, and exposition. Since no one story element predominates, readers pay equal attention to them all, thus experiencing a smooth, steady flow of prose. Here's an example of Normal Pace (from my novel Like Death): Scott drove to the Ash Creek Community Recreation Center, pulled into the lot, and slowly drove around the small traffic circle where people could drop off‘ their children. It really wasn't much to look at from the outside: brown brick, narrow, rectangular windows, large glass doors like a department store. The lawn was neatly mowed and the hedges trimmed. Ash Creek wasn't exactly a ritzy community, but that didn’t stop folks from trying. He drove back into the lot, found a space that afforded a good view of the front of the rec center, and parked. He sat and watched people in sweats and shorts come and go—old, young, in singles and pairs. Some talking and laughing, others quiet and expressionless, as if they were husbanding their energy for the physical exertions to come. Busy for a Sunday afternoon, he thought. While nothing special is happening here, the scene isn’t static, either. We're introduced to the setting; we experience action as the character looks for a place to park and observes people going in and out of the rec center; and we get a blend of physical description and the character's impressions of the center, as well as a touch of exposition about the town itself. While the scene is obviously moving toward something more important, the point is that the scene is still moving—and that's the strength of Normal Pace.

Fast Pace. 

Use Fast Pace when the story needs to shift to a higher gear, such as during an action scene or when your characters are engaged in an emotional confrontation. Be careful, though: Fast Pace can only go on so long before readers begin to get exhausted or numb. Switch to a different pace after one scene or chapter, perhaps Normal or Atmospheric Pace. To create Fast Pace, focus on one fictional element to the near exclusion of all others—just dialogue, just narration of action, etc. Since readers have fewer elements to pay attention to, they can move more rapidly through your prose. Here's Fast Pace in action: Mongoose-quick, Ravena cross-drew two black metal shuriken from her leather wrist sheathes and hurled them at Omega. As soon as the throwing stars left her hands, she was up and running toward the terrorist. Two steps toward Omega. He moved to the left, and the first shuriken passed through empty air where his face had been only a split second before. Two more steps. Omega was in trouble now. From their last encounter three years ago, Ravena remembered that he had a tendency to duck left—precisely where she had thrown the second star. He didn’t have time to step in either direction. All he could do was fall backward and hope the second star missed him. In this example (which admittedly might be more suited to a comic book than prose fiction), the emphasis is entirely on action and fast-forward story movement. There's no description beyond physical action, and even that is kept to a minimum. The short sentences increase reading speed, serving as “action bits” for readers to gulp down. It's almost impossible not to read this at a gallop—and that's what Fast Pace is all about. 

Atmospheric Pace. 

Employ this technique to create a mood or a specific feeling in a chapter. Atmospheric Pace can set a scene, establish a tone, or foreshadow events to come—often all at the same time. To create Atmospheric Pace, focus on blending physical and psychological description to set the mood you want your readers to experience. For example: Benjamin Strathearn lay half in, half out of the creek. From the knees down, his legs were immersed in cool running water, but the sensation was overpowered by the pain in his right side. It felt as if he were on fire inside, as if instead of a musket ball, his flesh had been penetrated by a white-hot coal that grew hotter by the moment. Benjamin's cheek pressed against the creek bank, grass tickling his nose, the blades swaying in the breeze caused by his panting breath. It was early spring in South Carolina. Trees were beginning to bud into life, and birds sang out, calling to potential mates. Squirrels rustled through the underbrush, raccoons, deer, who knew what else. Wolves, maybe, drawn by the smell of blood. He wondered if they’d wait for him to die or if their hunger would goad them into attacking sooner. He wondered if he cared. This example, set during America's Revolutionary War, contrasts the peacefulness of the natural setting with the violent injuries the protagonist has suffered. The physical descriptions of both the setting and the character's wounds are matched by his mental and emotional impressions of them, creating an overall effect of suspended time, a moment when life and death are in precarious balance. As always, the story is still moving forward, but the blend of the physical and the psychological suffuses the scene with the desired atmosphere—and who isn't going to read on to see which way the scales finally tip? 

Suspenseful Pace. 

We'll talk about techniques for generating suspense in much more detail in the next chapter (and you’ll see the following example used in that chapter as well). For right now, let's discuss suspense only as it applies to pace. When you want to keep readers on the edge of their seats, use Suspenseful Pace. To create Suspenseful Pace, focus on step-by- step detail and action that work toward but delay the ultimate payoff. Don't confuse Suspense with Fast Pace, though. Suspense is slow, but it seems fast because readers speed up as they rush to see how events play out. Example: He's close. It wasn't so much a thought as it was an instinct, a prickle on the back of her neck, a tightening in her gut. Laura paused at a pawn broker's and pretended to look through the window at the items displayed: guitars, jewelry, video cameras . . . She was uncomfortably aware of what a good target she made—standing still, back of the head presented almost as if she had a bull's- eye tattooed there. She could almost imagine him sighting on her head, seeing it through cross-hairs, finger on the trigger, skin not sweaty, flesh cool as he calmly, professionally, began to squeeze . . . Stop it, she told herself. Neal would never risk acquiring her on a busy city street. There were too many witnesses; Neal preferred to work neat. Besides, it was too windy. As good a shot as he was, he might well miss. And Neal absolutely loathed taking a second shot. So much so that he never loaded a weapon with more than one round of ammunition. One of his more colorful personality quirks. Still, she was grateful for it now—it meant she was relatively safe. Emphasis on relatively. The accumulation of step-by-step detail as the character becomes aware she's being hunted—and struggles not to look like she’s aware—allows readers to experience the same anxiety as the character. Will Neal take a shot? How will Laura get away? Readers will increase their reading speed to find out the answers as quickly as they can. Plus, the indication that Laura knows Neal, as well as something of how assassins operate, will make readers curious about their relationship and even more eager for the eventual confrontation between the two characters. Different pacing techniques can be used to create individual scenes within a story or book chapter—one scene employing Atmospheric Pace, the next Suspenseful Pace, and the third Fast Pace. They can also form the basis for entire chapters. Use different pacing techniques whenever and however they best seem to serve the needs of your story. Keep in mind, though, that whatever else you do, you want to maintain an overall varied pace throughout a finished piece of fiction, so try to avoid having several scenes or chapters in a row that use the same technique. The power of you. "This is a hell of a story, but I'm not sure this is the way to tell it." A number of years ago, I submitted a story titled “Ghost in the Graveyard" to an anthology called Gothic Ghosts, edited by horror legend Charles L. Grant. I knew Charlie a little from the Genie boards (a forerunner of today's social media), but not so well that I felt comfortable writing him and asking him to clarify his comment. I didn't really need him to explain, though. I knew what he was reacting to: the story was written in second person. For some people, reading a story in second person is an acquired taste, while others would rather gargle with battery acid than subject themselves to second person. I can't remember if “Ghost in the Graveyard” was the first time I wrote in second person, but a quick glance at my bibliography shows that it was the first such story I had published. It appeared in All Hallows in June 2000. Since then I’ve written around twenty more second-person stories, which is about a seventh of all the short fiction I’ve had published. Not a huge proportion of my overall output, perhaps, but enough to form a collection of its own. As the years go by, I seem to be writing in second person more often, and one of my most recent second-person stories, “How to be a Horror Writer,” was nominated for a Shirley Jackson Award. If readers have been exposed to second-person fiction at all, it's most likely through Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books. But unless they read literary fiction or were an English major in college, they probably haven't encountered it anywhere else. Which is a shame, because second person can achieve effects that first and third person can't. Here are some things to consider when writing in second person.

- Use present tense with second person. Past tense—“You were eating an apple and you thought it was delicious"—doesn’t work well with second-person stories. Using you already keeps the reader at a distance from the story (which I’ll talk about later), so using past tense would push them away even farther. Present tense works better for second-person stories. Present tense is weird in fiction. You would think that present tense would indicate to readers that the events they're reading about are happening right now, this very instant, creating a sense of immediacy and urgency. But instead present-tense narratives come across as passive and lacking in energy. This is one of the reasons literary writers often favor present tense. They want to avoid any hint of melodrama in their work, want it to appeal to the intellect rather than emotions. The passive nature of present tense can intensify the distancing effect of passive voice.

- Second person creates cognitive dissonance in the reader. You’re constantly telling the reader that he or she is doing something when they damn well know they’re not. It's almost as if their subconscious is always reminding them that You are not this person and you are not doing this thing. This is one of the main reasons readers have trouble with present-tense stories, I think. But it’s also one of the great strengths of second person. Instead of inviting readers to relax and fall into the story, second person makes them wrestle with it mentally. Reading is always an interactive experience for readers, but second person creates a different sort of interaction. This effect works well for horror and weird fiction. Readers feel uncertain, unsure what to expect. They aren't safe. Safe fiction is comfort food for the mind, and there's nothing whatsoever wrong with that. But unsafe fiction can affect readers far more deeply and leave a lasting impression. Second person creates a distancing effect. It puts the reader in the position of being an observer rather than a participant in the story. It keeps them at arm's length, keeps them off balance. This isn't the normal way a story is told (as far as they’re concerned), so they aren't quite sure what's going to happen. They aren't sure of the “rules.” As I said earlier, they aren’t safe. And good horror fiction—any fiction that matters—should never be safe. Second person creates a numbing effect, and it has a flat, steady pace. If a character is experiencing something outside of what they believe to be the norm, something that is unreal or nightmarish, second person can create the same sort of detached numbness people experience when they're dreaming. Second person allows readers to experience the same dreamlike detachment that the viewpoint character in a story experiences. The flat pace works well to create a sense of creeping menace, of a slow, inexorable progression toward whatever awfulness awaits at the end. 

- Second person tends to work better at short lengths rather than long ones. Jay McKinney's famous second-person novel Bright Lights, Big City is a slim book, running under 50,000 words. I think the effects of second person—the distancing, the observer effect, the numbing, the flat, steady pace—can wear on most readers after a time. The effect can't be sustained past a certain point. Exactly where that point is depends on the individual reader, but in general, I'd say that second person works best at short story or novella length. Second person appeals more to readers of literary fiction than readers of commercial fiction. This is another reason narratives written in second-person are rare. Commercial fiction doesn't necessarily mean hackwork. I write a great deal of commercial fiction, usually for the media tie-in novels that l do, and I strive to make these novels just as good as anything else I write. But commercial fiction is intended to appeal to the widest audience possible. To do this, it needs to be relatable and readable. It needs to welcome readers to the story and its characters, not keep them outside the story, as second person does. Since Choose Your Own Adventure-type stories directly address the reader at each decision point—If you want to open the door, tum to page 37. If you want to leave the door closed, turn to page 113—second person works well. This is the only regular use of second person in commercial fiction that I'm aware of, though. Second person is more of a literary technique than an entertainment-focused technique. Second person can broaden a reader's perspective on what fiction is and what it can do. It's always good for readers to encounter narrative styles they may be unfamiliar with. The more varied reading experiences they have, the better readers they become overall. Stronger readers are more likely to expand their reading tastes and try new types of stories, which in turn makes them even better readers, further enriching their lives. Second person can be one more tool to help readers gain a deeper appreciation of literature, making writers better ambassadors for our art form. How do I decide when to use second person? When I want to create any of the previously mentioned effects. 

Instinct. 

Sometimes a story feels as if it should be written in second person. Why, I don't know. When I feel this, I don't question it. I just go with it. When I'm not sure how to find my way into a story, I play around with different techniques. My short stories tend to be less plotted out than my novels, and they often focus on very abstract or imagistic ideas. This means that I’m not always certain how and where to begin a story. I’ll draft different beginnings, using different techniques and voices, and whichever turns out to be the key to unlock the story for me, that's the one I use. Sometimes second person is that key. When what I'm writing is very personal. I mentioned Bright Lights, Big City earlier. McKinney's novel is based on his experiences as a young man living and working in New York City during the 1980's: lots of partying, lots of coke, lots of sex. He had trouble writing the book until he tried second person. I believe using second person created the distancing effect he needed in order to write about his experiences, even in a fictionalized form. It works the same for me. When I'm writing a story that's drawn very closely from my own experience, so much so that it could almost be a personal essay if I wrote it differently, second person gives me the distance I need in order to write about that experience. It helps me be a more detached observer of my own life, which allows me to work more effectively with my experiences as words and ideas on the page.

When I’m having trouble getting started on a story, I often go straight to second person without trying different techniques. Writing stories in second person is as natural to me as breathing. The words pour out of me like water when I use second person. I'm not sure why. Maybe there’s a part of me that's always a detached observer of my own life. (I wouldn't be surprised if most artists are like this.) Writing in second person allows me to tap into that observer part of me. I serve as a mentor for the Horror Writers Association, and a while back I was mentoring a gentleman who was an award-winning playwright and teacher of playwrighting. He wanted to learn to write fiction more effectively, but when I read his stories, I could see that he was writing them as if they were plays, just with more words-description, narration, etc.—surrounding the dialogue. I knew that he was writing stories from the same perspective as he was writing plays: from the perspective of someone sitting in the audience and watching. I wanted to show him that he needed to write with a close attachment to one character's viewpoint, as if he were one of the actors on stage experiencing the events of the play as they progressed. I wasn't sure how to explain this, so I sat down to write a story, paying attention to how I focused my awareness when I wrote, hoping that I'd come up with the right concepts and vocabulary to communicate to my mentee the difference between writing from an audience member's perspective and writing from an individual character's perspective. I wrote a second-person story, which already has a detached observer's point of view embedded in the technique. It worked. I was able to show my mentee the difference between the two ways of approaching writing. If you've never tried to write fiction in second person, read some examples then give it a shot. You might find it an interesting and rewarding challenge. You'll add another technique to your writer’s toolkit, and who knows? You might discover a new voice to speak with. Heightened awareness. Recently, I presented at a writers‘ workshop alongside a romance-author friend of mine. During her sessions, she discussed an element of romance fiction that one of her editors had dubbed “heightened awareness." This term describes the exaggerated sensory impressions that two would-be lovers experience in a romance story, sensory impressions that are so strong they create an increasingly irresistible attraction, an inevitable pull toward one another. As my friend talked about this concept, I realized that horror writers employ the same technique, but we do so by presenting characters’ sensory impressions that focus on their experience of fear. My friend said heightened awareness in romance isn't realistic. It's more of an idealized fantasy version of what humans experience. In other words, a romantic version, in all senses of the word. Horror writers, however, have reality on our side when it comes to presenting our characters’ heightened awareness. The fight or flight response—and the chemical reactions it causes—does heighten our awareness. We do perceive details during moments of fear that might otherwise escape our notice. I think this is a big reason why some horror fiction flounders and is ultimately ineffective. It doesn't realistically portray characters‘ fear even when they’re in unrealistic situations (or in situations that are outside of normal everyday human experience, such as being attacked by a serial killer). Using heightened awareness to convey characters’ terror is one of the most important techniques a horror writer can employ, maybe the most important. Strive for balance, though. Where some writers do too little to create an atmosphere of heightened awareness, some do too much. Don't exaggerate and overwrite to the point of accidental parody. For example: Jill felt an icy gust of air strike the back of her neck, as frigid, sharp, and painful as ten thousand spears made of pure Antarctic ice. The cold entered her body like a torrent of industrial coolant pumped into her by some gigantic hypodermic wielded by the hand of an enormous, monstrous being. Her internal temperature dropped rapidly and her body was wracked by uncontrollable seismic shudders, as if she were in the thrall of a grand mal seizure. Her extremities became numb, and an instant later they began to burn as if she'd plunged them into a vat of gasoline and then into a raging bonfire. The mistake in the above passage is going on and on about one sensory detail to the point of ridiculousness. Effective description is created from an accumulation of small details that build to an overall effect. Here's a better example: A cold breeze kissed the back of her neck, and she shivered. One detail, one description. The exaggeration, the heightened awareness? My use of the word kissed to describe the character's experience of the sensation, followed by the result: a shiver that is not only caused by the cold but by the sensual feel of a kiss on an especially sensitive—and exposed—part of the human body. A kiss that was an unexpected and invasive intimacy. A small attack. This one sentence—A cold breeze kissed the back of her neck, and she shivered—is far more effective and impactful than the previous word-vomit example, which creates a distance between the reader and the text, keeps the reader from imagining the feel of the breeze on the back of the character’s neck because the writer is too busy telling the reader what the character's reaction is.

What makes good horror/dark fantasy/suspense?

2. 

What's the best advice you can give to a beginning writer of horror/dark fantasy/suspense?

Lee Murray, award-winning author of Into the Ashes

1. 

Good horror is heavy on the d's: death, darkness, and dread are the big ones. All good horror includes these in some form. After that, select from disfigurement, dismemberment, disgust, disaster, difference . . . Intensity is important, too. It's not just about being dark; the reader has to sense the horror in the darkness.

2. 

Think of it like a Mad Hatter’s tea party. No room at the literature table? Sit clown anyway. Take the rabbit hole to the underworld. Conjure shrink—grow monsters, evil queens, the perfidy of time, and lonely, spiraling madness. Choose chaos as a ruling principle. Ask the hard questions. Say what you mean. Talk when you want to. Debate the intricacies of language. Hide the bodies of your friends in teapots. Cut off their heads. Reference Poe. And drink more of the beverage of your choice.

Chuck Wendig, bestselling author of Wanderers

1. 

Horror as a genre is in so many strange places in terms of both the genre itself and what publishing expects of it, so I really don't know. I think it's just a good, scary story (emphasis on the “good story” part).

2. 

Don't worry about what scares people. Just worry about what scares YOU. 

John Claude Smith, author of The Wilderness Within

1.

Horror is meant to disturb readers, to touch readers, to shake up the norm and leave them wary of that which lurks in the shadows, or perhaps in their own unreliable thoughts. The subtleties of dread or the visceral, violent dismantling of the physical or psychological are key methods meant to touch readers deeply. One avenue of good horror I have found most ominous is the extermination of Hope. It is the moment when readers realize all traces of a happy ending have been annihilated. Where do we go from here? There is no sunlight in the answers, only perseverance, endurance. And more questions about the futility of it all, magnified by the horror of one’s continued existence. This is true horror.

2.

Embrace whatever raises your cackles and expound on them in a way that every reader can relate. Be it subtle or dripping with blood, the universal fears are always a good starting point upon which each writer builds his or her own body of work, weaving in the themes and obsessions that make them unique to said writer.

Patrick Lacey, author of Where the Stars Won't Shine

1.

I'm big on dread. If an author creates a consistent sense of dread throughout a novel or short story or what have you, count me in. Some writers are so great at this, it makes me hate them (in a good way) because it's so darn hard to pull off In horror, it shouldn't just be the monster/haunting/central conflict that’s making you squirm. It's everything else. It’s the character's reactions. Maybe they feel like they're being followed even when they aren't. Maybe everyday objects—cell phones, newspapers, televisions—take on a sinister quality. I think if you can pull that off, you've got the reader by throat. Or at least this one.

2.

Show-don't-tell is, I think, more important in horror than any other genre. Don't tell us your main character is scared. Show us her shaking hands. Show us the sweat on her forehead. Show us that voice in her head that’s screaming Get the hell out of here now because there's definitely something with too many eyes and too many teeth around that corner. The more time you spend on describing your character's fear without showing the effects of it, the more the tension will ramp down. Then that thing with the eyes and teeth is just another plot point.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

THE ART OF SUSPENSE

“The suspense is terrible. I hope it will last.”—Oscar Wilde

I’ve mentioned suspense several times so far, but now we're going to dig into it. Suspense is a genre unto itself, of course, but it overlaps horror quite a bit. But I'm not talking about suspense as a genre in this chapter; I mean suspense as a technique. It's one of the primary tools in horror writing because it focuses on the anticipation of something bad happening, as opposed to focusing on the Bad Thing itself. Remember the example with Laura looking into the pawnshop which I used in the last chapter? We're going to look at it in more detail now. First, a version that lacks suspense. No suspense: Laura stood outside a pawn shop window, pretending to look at the items for sale inside, while wondering if an assassin was targeting her. Suspenseful: He’s close. It wasn't so much a thought as it was an instinct, a prickle on the back of her neck, a tightening in her gut. Laura paused at a pawn broker's and pretended to look through the window at the items displayed: guitars, jewelry, video cameras . . . She was uncomfortably aware of what a good target she made—standing still, back of the head presented almost as if she had a bull’s-eye tattooed there. She could almost imagine him sighting on her head, seeing it through cross-hairs, finger on the trigger, skin not sweaty, flesh cool as he calmly, professionally, began to squeeze . . . Stop it, she told herself. Neal would never risk acquiring her on a busy city street. There were too many witnesses; Neal preferred to work neat. Besides, it was too windy. Even as good a shot as he was, he might well miss. And Neal absolutely loathed taking a second shot. So much so that he never loaded a weapon with more than one round of ammunition. One of his more colorful personality quirks. Still, she was grateful for it now—it meant she was relatively safe. Emphasis on relatively. The first example isn’t written with a close attachment to Laura's point of view. It's not immersive. It briefly describes the scene and explains what Laura is doing and what's on her mind. It's clear and direct, but it's boring and doesn't involve the reader in the scene. The second example is immersive, and we remain firmly in Laura’s viewpoint the entire time. We know not only what she sees and hears, but what she’s thinking and feeling. We stay in the moment with her, not rushing through her experience. We know right away that something is wrong, even if we're not sure yet what it is. Details are presented that hint at the problem, which is made clear by the end. The main effect of the scene is to focus on a nervous or fearful anticipation that something bad may occur, but that something does not happen in the scene. Nothing occurs in the real world. Everything of importance in this short scene happens in Laura's head. There's nothing about the first example to make you want to keep reading, but the second example—while perhaps not deathless prose—captures readers’ attention, draws them in, involves them in Laura's situation, and creates a feeling of suspense that will make them want to keep reading. More than that, they’ll need to keep reading. One of the things you want to do in your writing is to make it impossible for readers to stop reading. Suspense is one of the best ways to do that. On one level, suspense is simply a heightened and sharpened version of that basic question at the heart of all storytelling: What's going to happen next? But there are very specific techniques to create suspense, so let’s get into them. First, let’s define suspense. Audiences feel suspense when they anticipate something bad is going to happen to a character—usually one they find sympathetic or can relate to. The audience often has more knowledge of what the something bad is than the character does, but they can't do anything to help the character. So in my example with Laura, I could’ve made sure readers know that an assassin is stalking her, but she doesn’t. Readers would be anticipating—but not knowing when or how—the assassin will strike, or even if he'll strike. And there's nothing readers can do to help Laura or make events occur faster in order to decrease their suspense. Suspense is an uncomfortable feeling, even if—like Oscar Wilde—we enjoy it. We want the suspense to be relieved, but we also want it to last as long as possible. So how do you do it?
Make your character a normal person. A normal person doesn't have special training, skills, or abilities to help them deal with threats. That increases suspense because they can't easily deal with threats—physically, mentally, or emotionally. Give the reader a superior viewpoint. If readers know a Bad Thing is coming—even if the nature of that Bad Thing is unclear—and the character doesn't, suspense is created. Imagine looking out a corner window of a tall building, one whose position allows you to see two streets that intersect. You see a bicyclist speeding down one street, and you see an out-of-control semi-truck speeding down the other. The truck and the bike are headed for a collision (with a very nasty one-sided outcome). You can anticipate what’s coming, but you can't do anything about it, and you can’t look away. The technique of the superior viewpoint is used in horror movies all the time. Audiences know a masked killer is stalking his victim, but the victim is completely clueless. Even if he or she starts to get a bad feeling that they’re being followed, they don't know for sure that they’re in danger until the killer attacks. Use time constraints. A ticking bomb. A poison that requires an antidote to be given within two hours. A curse that, if it's not removed by dawn, becomes permanent. A runaway train that will crash into the station within twenty minutes if it can't be stopped. A damaged spacecraft that's in a decaying orbit and will fall to Earth within six hours. A newly made vampire that will remain a vampire forever if he or she isn’t cured before they first taste blood. Time constraints force characters to work faster, prevent them from seeking help from others—police, the government, Ghostbusters . . . Time constraints are probably easier to create for thrillers than for horror stories, although some supernatural entities have their own built-in time constraints (which humans might be able to exploit when battling them). Vampires must return to their coffins before sunrise. Werewolves only transform during the cycle of the full moon. Samara’s curse in The Ring takes seven days to come to fruition. The time constraints may originate from the monsters, but they impact the characters who must deal with them, too. Apply pressure. In general, you always want your characters’ situations to worsen as the story goes on. But if you want to create maximum suspense, you need to apply more pressure to your characters (in addition to time constraints). Maybe more people than the main character become endangered as the story goes on, perhaps someone near and dear to the main character. Perhaps the main character gets injured along the way, making it harder to deal with the threat. Or maybe the injury is so severe the character is in danger of bleeding out (another time constraint) if he or she doesn’t get medical attention soon. Cars break down or run out of gas. A hazardous storm erupts. A mountain pass is blocked by an avalanche. Any complication that puts more pressure on your characters will help increase your story's suspense. Create dilemmas. Give characters difficult—if not impossible—choices. To save the world from an ancient demon, they must sacrifice the soul of the one they love most. Zombies break into a house where you and your friends have holed up. You can escape, but only if you abandon your friends and leave them to die. Or worse, leaving your family to die. And if you try to help them, there’s an excellent chance you’ll die, too. Presenting characters with difficult choices helps ramp up the suspense, this time on an emotional level. The more levels you can create suspense on—mental, emotional, physical, spiritual/moral—the stronger the overall suspense in your story will be. Complicate matters. This could be considered in the same category as applying pressure to characters, but the complications don't have to be major ones. Small ones work, too. A character loses the keys to her motorcycle and has no transportation. How many movies have you seen where characters who need to get somewhere fast—or get away from someone fast—encounter the Unexpected Festival Fair/Carnival/ Parade? They're slowed way down by all the celebrants and often become separated from one another. A complication can come from the characters themselves. One hides his or her injury from the others or fails to disclose an important medical condition. Maybe the characters don't agree on how best to proceed next. Maybe one character has a secret agenda. Maybe a pair of characters used to be lovers and now have trouble getting along. Maybe one character makes impulsive, reckless choices, endangering others. Maybe one character will always put his or her interests ahead of others. Maybe a character has a secret that, once revealed, changes the other characters’ relationship to him or her. And of course, there's always the character who eventually betrays the others. (“Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal") Complications like these have nothing to do with the Bad Thing your characters must deal with, but they sure as hell make dealing with the threat harder. They also make your story seem more realistic. Problems like the ones I've discussed in this section occur in real life all the time. I’ve even run into the Unexpected Festival/ Fair/ Carnival Parade a couple times while driving. Just because a Bad Thing has entered your characters’ lives doesn't make other problems vanish (although they may take a backseat),
and it doesn’t mean that new problems won't arise during the time they attempt to deal with the Bad Thing. Be unpredictable. If your readers can guess with a fair degree of certainty where your story is going, you’re doing your job wrong. Remember, all fiction is mystery, and people read for the joy of discovery. They like being surprised, and readers who try to figure your plot out ahead of time like being proved wrong. Plus, if readers can't anticipate what’s going to happen next—and the same goes for your characters—they‘ll experience more unease and anxiety, leading to . . . You got it. An increase in suspense. Here are a few techniques for being unpredictable.

- Have characters make incorrect assumptions based on incomplete or incorrect knowledge.

- Have characters make bad choices but for good—or at least good to them—reasons.

- From the very beginning, have each story beat turn out differently than you expect. For example, if in your outline (or if you don't outline, then in your intentions for a scene as you draft it) your main character is driving across town to get to an important job interview, arrives late, is nervous, but still aces the interview, what would occur if the opposite happens? What if your character never makes it to the interview? The event that stops your character could very well spin your story off in an unsuspected—but interesting—direction. And as you continue with the story, you continue making the opposite of what you want to have happen occur. This is a great way to avoid writing stale, predictable plots which readers will not only welcome, this element of uncertainty might give you added enthusiasm for your story. As you write it, you'll be excited to see what happens next. And of course unpredictability increases suspense because both characters and readers will be off balance throughout your story. Less violence. The threat of violence, the anticipation of it, creates stress. Once an act of violence occurs in your story, it can no longer be anticipated. And if your story moves quickly from one act of violence to another, there's no time for suspense to build up again. The Shining does this well. The threat of violence against Danny and his mother builds throughout the novel until it explodes toward the end, and we race through the pages to see how the promise of violence King made to us turns out. If you make a promise, keep it. If King promised violence against Danny and his mother throughout The Shining and then—in a bold move to be unpredictable—he had no violence take place, readers would hurl the book across the room. (And since it's so thick, it would probably put a good-sized dent in the wall.) Having a character miss a job interview is one thing. Foreshadowing an important story event (or what readers think will be an important event) and then not having that event happen will only frustrate your audience. At the end of Kill Bill: Vol. 2 Tarantino has the final confrontation between Uma Thurman's and David Carradine’s characters occur in a very different way than we expect from a pair of films that were jam-packed with action—thereby playing with audience expectation—but the confrontation still happens. Tarantino kept his promise, but in an unexpected way. Isolate your protagonist. Cut your main character off from any and all support as the story progresses, either bit by bit or all at once. Friends, family, co-workers, police, medical professionals . . . The fewer people your main character can turn to for help, the harder it will be for him or her to solve problems. And if people think your character is dangerous, or even the Bad Thing itself, they may not only withhold help but seek to capture and maybe kill the “threat." Isolating your protagonist can make him or her desperate, willing to take chances and do things that would ordinarily be out of character. We’re almost finished. Just one last tip to pass along. The absolutely most important thing to know about creating suspense is . . .

What makes good horror/dark fantasy/suspense?

2.

What's the best advice you can give to a beginning writer of horror/dark fantasy/suspense?

Alison Littlewood, author of Mistletoe

1.

Good horror makes you prickle—with recognition, not necessarily outright fear or suspense, though I enjoy both those things. An effective horror story looks beyond the surface and tells us what it is to be human, that carries insight about ourselves and our responses to something bigger than that: the unanswered questions, the meaning of life, the mythic resonance of the world, things that speak to our soul. Horror is often said to be about fear: of the unknown, of death, of pain. But good horror is often really about love, because it's only when we love something that we truly know what it is to face its loss.

2.

Don't overthink it. Don't rest on the things you've read before, or seen in the latest movie, or the stories others are telling. Dig deep. Write what scares you. Let the work surprise you. The things in my books that readers say they didn't see coming tend to be the ones that I didn't see coming either, not until the characters told me that’s what had to happen. Sometimes you have to let go and fly before the whirlwind—or at least keep ahead of the inner editor—and see what you can snatch from the air. Oh, and welcome to the fold . . .

John Palisano, award-winning author of Night of 1,000 Beasts

1.

To me, it all comes down to finding and transcribing the emotions of the work. Making emotions genuine and real makes the difference in a work getting under and sticking under the skin.

2.

First, know your characters as much as you know any of your favorites. Second, make sure the stakes are high, remain high, and intensify.

Wesley Southarrl, author of One for the Road

1.

Discomfort and unease. I read a lot, and I know what I like. The best stories, those that truly stick out in my mind years after finishing them, are the ones that make me remember, in the moment, how my heart raced or my mouth went dry. How I would have done anything to jump inside with the characters and keep them from harm. How, no matter where I was, I had to read just one more chapter, one more page. The best dark fiction forces you to never want to look away, no matter how bleak things might seem. Make me unhappy to put your work down, and you'll have a fan for life.

2.

Just be yourself and write what makes you happy. If you enjoy blood and gore, then by all means splatter the walls with red. If you're into slow, creeping dread, then make the reader fear walking around every corner. Write to serve the story, not the reader's expectations. Surprise them. Shock them. Scare them. And most importantly, entertain them. We're writing dark fiction here. Unlike most other genres, we have the unique opportunity to access nearly every human emotion in the reader’s mind. Take advantage, and you'll leave the reader with an experience they won’t soon forget.

Sephera Giron, author of Captured Souls

1.

A good horror story often has at least one character the audience can identify with or can root for to survive or die horribly. An original angle on an old trope can also ratchet the experience up. Sometimes not seeing "the monster" can be more effective than pages of description. And of course, the best horror stories have a beginning, a middle and an ending that are rather defined (even endings that don’t wrap everything up in a bow are fine if done properly), so the reader doesn’t have to spend half the book wondering what's going on.

2.

Read a lot of the type of horror you want to write so that you don't write the same story someone else just published. If your scene doesn’t scare YOU, it might not scare the reader. Of course, everything doesn’t have to scare you to death but if you get a little shiver or goosebumps while writing a scene, then you're on the right track. Be aware that sometimes your favorite scenes aren't your best writing and often drag down the book, so self-editing needs to be ruthless in subsequent drafts. Write your first draft without a worry in the world. After that first draft, you can get out the axe and chop away. You likely can chop off the first five to ten pages of a novel.

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

LET THEM FIGHT!

I've got a confession to make. I hate writing action scenes. Well . . . maybe hate is too strong a word, at least these days. I've written action scenes for so many different books—horror, fantasy, tie-ins, novelizations—that writing action has gotten easier for me. And I've gotten fairly decent at it. One of the reasons my editor at Titan Books asked me to write the novelization of Kingsman: The Golden Circle was because she thought I was good at writing action. And who am I to argue with an editor? Especially when she says nice things about me. So let's talk about writing action scenes. Set the mood. I usually don't listen to music when I write, especially music with lyrics. I find the words of the songs get in the way of the words I'm trying to write. But fast-paced music, often with a hard edge, helps me write action scenes. Not only does it get me in the proper mindset to write action, it inspires me to put the same kind of frenetic energy into the prose. I used Elton John‘s “Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting” when writing the Kingsman novelization because I knew from the script that the song was going to be used in the film. When writing my sea monster thriller Teeth of the Sea, I listened to something a little different: Themes from Classic Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Films, which features music from the giant-monsters-attack movies Tarantula and The Deadly Mantis, among others. Movie soundtracks work great, too. They can help inspire you to bring a cinematic feel to your action scenes. Something else I do to prepare for writing action scenes is to watch action movies, and I also read action-adventure novels. I want to immerse myself in action sequences, both visual and written, so I have an action mindset when I sit down to write.
Use Scene and Sequel. I first encountered this technique at SF conventions, where panelists would talk about how it was the key to writing effective, saleable fiction (as I discussed in Chapter Fifteen: “Tell Me a Scary Story”). You can Google “scene and sequel writing" or “scene and sequel fiction“ to learn more about this technique (and I encourage you all to do so), but here's a recap of the technique. Fiction can be divided into two basic units. a SCENE, in which a character takes active steps to achieve a small goal that helps him or her make progress toward the larger story goal, and a SEQUEL, in which that character processes the outcome of the scene and decides on his or her next move, which leads directly into the next SCENE, and so on, until the story is finished. One day while writing an action scene for a novel, I realized that action scenes were nothing but a fast-moving chain of Scenes and Sequels. For example: Bob wants to get out of a burning building, but his arch nemesis Jim is determined to keep him inside so they’ll both burn to death. SCENE: Bob wants to reach the front door, so he starts running. Jim tackles him and they both fall to the floor. SEQUEL (which can be an instinctive reaction instead of a well thought-out plan): Jim is lying atop Bob, so Bob decides to slam his head back into Bob's face. SCENE: Bob does so, stunning Jim, who rolls off Bob's back. SEQUEL: Bob is now free to move, so he will. SCENE: Bob gets to his feet and starts heading for the door once more. Jim has a baseball in his pocket. (Why, I don’t know—just go with it). He pulls out the baseball and throws it at Bob. It hits Bob in the back of the head. SEQUEL: Bob exclaims, “Ow!” The pain of the impact causes Bob to stagger, slowing him down. He fights through the pain and dizziness because he needs to get to that door. SCENE: Bob continues toward the door, staggering and weaving, moving slower now. And so on. Using Scene and Sequel allows you to choreograph a fight scene—especially when you remember that each character has his or her own chain of Scenes and Sequels. In order to determine Bob's actions and reactions, I also had to know what Jim's were. Scene and Sequel also helps you remain anchored firmly in the present action so you don't rush it. (More on this later.) Focus on the character's immediate goal. In the above example, I focused on one goal: Bob wants to get the hell out of the burning building. Jim may be his arch enemy, but Bob doesn't have time to settle old scores, no matter how satisfying that might be. He has to get out or he'll burn to death. Everything in the action sequence needs to be focused on Bob trying to escape and Jim trying to keep him from doing so. If physical action won't work, maybe Bob will try to reason with Jim, even offer to make a bargain with him of some kind—anything that will get him out of the burning building. As the fire spreads and the situation becomes more dire, Bob's actions will become more frantic, more desperate, and more instinctive. Maybe he’ll give into that, maybe he'll fight it.
The goal can change during an action sequence, too. Maybe Bob is almost out of the building when he hears a baby crying from somewhere in the room, and his goal shifts to save the baby, and then escape. Remaining focused on your characters’ immediate goals will help you write sharper, more intense action scenes. Write individualized action scenes. Too often in action movies, everyone can do everything. All the characters are equally good at fighting, driving, etc., and all the fights, chases, and escapes are the same. (The only exception is Asian bad-guy warriors, who almost always possess superhuman martial arts skills that somehow good guys can counter with only basic street-fighting moves.) But all of your characters have different backgrounds, training, and experience (or in the case of a normal everyday person thrust into an action scene, no training or experience). They also have different psychological makeups. How do they normally deal with problems? Do they tackle them head-on? Do they seek others’ help in dealing with them? Do they try to manipulate others into dealing with them instead? Do they try to ignore problems and hope they’ll go away? How do your characters deal with an unexpected threat? Will they immediately leap into whatever action is necessary? Will they stand there, stunned, in terror or disbelief? How do they deal with stress? (The stress of conflict takes its toll on characters no matter what sort of story they inhabit). Do they rise to the occasion? Do they check out mentally? Do they go over to the Dark Side so they can survive? Do they betray companions so they can survive? Knowing how each character deals with problems and reacts to stress (both immediate and long-term) will help you decide what they'll do, and not do, in action sequences. Write with a deep point of view. As I’ve established more than once in this book, I believe an immersive point of view is the best way to go when writing fiction. So far, none of our other ways of experiencing story—movies, TV shows, video-games—is capable of getting into characters’ heads, allowing us to experience what they're experiencing. It's one of the great strengths of prose fiction. If you write with an immersive point of view, we'll know what a character thinks and feels, both emotionally and physically, during an action scene. The action will be intense because, in a way, it's happening to us. Avoid writing your action scenes as if you're viewing them on a screen. Write them as if you're living them. When I talk about this in classes, I show an action clip from one the Bourne movies, then I show the video for Biting Elbows‘ song “Bad Motherfucker." The latter is filmed from the point of view of a James Bond-like spy. I tell students to imagine action scenes (any scene, really) as if they're the character in that video. (The same people who created the video made the film Hardcore Harry, which is also presented as if we're seeing the story through the main character's eyes.) Stay in the moment. As I've mentioned before, I was an acting major for a time in college, and one of the most important lessons an actor has to learn is to “play the moment." This means don't rush dialogue, don't rush past the emotional beats in a scene. When writing action scenes, don’t rush through the chain of events. Allow your characters to have responses and make choices, however quick they may take place. Allow them to having physical and emotional responses to the actions they take or are taken against them. Staying in the moment is what makes an action scene feel real, and it helps create intensity and build suspense. Real people vs. superheroes. Too many writers write about characters who, while supposedly human, possess superhuman strength, speed, endurance, and resistance to injury. Even if your character is an action-adventure badass, he or she will slow down during an action sequence from the build—up of lactic acid in their muscles, if not from injuries. The most believable action sequence I've ever seen in film was in John Carpenter's They Live. Roddy Piper and Keith David are fighting in an alley. The fight starts off high energy, but as it goes on, the combatants slow down, become out of breath and exhausted. That's the way a real fight would go. There's little suspense with characters like Batman and Superman, until Batman's back is broken and Superman is suffering from kryptonite poisoning. It's not what you give heroes that makes them interesting; it's what you take away from them. So consider not writing about superheroes in the first place, but if you do, try to make their action scenes believable. Let them get winded, get tired, get hurt. And let them make mistakes. Maybe they don't make every jump they take or hit every target they shoot at, even if they ultimately succeed in a story. And think about how your characters will feel physically and emotionally after the action is over. Tired but exhilarated? Sick to their stomach over the violence they committed? So upset they’re determined never to raise a fist in violence ever again? Surprised—and maybe more than a little ashamed—to discover they like violence and want to commit more? The aftereffects of action are just as important as the action itself. Effects of adrenaline and other stress chemicals. I discussed this topic earlier in Chapter Thirteen: “The Physiology of Horror." But to recap, writers forget that the bodies of characters in action scenes are flooded with adrenaline and stress chemicals. It doesn't matter if these characters are well-trained and experienced action veterans or newbies. The veterans will be able to handle the effects of these chemicals better, but they’ll still experience them. Questions to ask yourself: How does your character's body work during fear? After fear? How do your character's senses perform during fear? How effectively can your character process information during an action/fear scene? How effectively can they think and react? I read once that the reason so many shots were fired during the gunfight at the OK Corral was because the participants‘ bodies were so full of adrenaline, their physical actions were too fast, too broad, too erratic for them to shoot accurately. If that's true, maybe it explains the lousy aim of the Stormtroopers in the Star Wars universe. How far will they go? How far is your character willing to go in an action scene? What risks will he or she take? Will your character jump off a cliff like the anti-heroes in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? Will he or she be willing to face a shark in its own element, as in jaws? In a fight, how much violence are they psychologically prepared to commit? It's easy to hurt and kill humans. Stick thumbs through their eye sockets into their brains. Slice their carotid artery. Bash their brains out with a heavy object. But most people won't immediately go for those moves. You need to know what moves your character will make naturally, and which they'll make when pushed somewhat, and which they'll make when they’re pushed to the wall and feel they have no other choice. Clarity is everything. One of my favorite sentences that I've ever read in fiction came from a novelization of one of the Friday the 13th movies, written by Simon Hawke: “Jason surged out of the water like a Polaris missile." I still laugh at the silliness of the image. The simile doesn't work at all (nothing against Simon Hawke. I enjoyed the rest of the book just fine). A Polaris missile is military tech, sciencey instead of slashery, and a missile is far more deadly than one dude with a machete could ever be, making Jason seem like a much lesser threat. Readers need to be able to picture clearly and accurately everything that's happening in an action scene, not least because it's (hopefully) fast-paced and they’re reading it quickly. If someone read the above sentence too fast, they might think a missile actually followed Jason out of Crystal Lake. Even if they realized it was a simile, they’ll still picture a Polaris missile shooting out of the water, and the image will clash with what’s really going on. Because of this, I try to avoid using similes and metaphors in action scenes, and I advise you to do the same.
Use dynamic language and fast-paced writing. Put energy into your writing so the words themselves feel like action. Instead of saying, “She ran into the shadows," say, "She plunged into the shadows.” Instead of saying “Bob hit Jim," say, “Bob slammed his fist into Jim’s jaw.” Instead of saying, “Jim let out a gust of air,” say, “The wind whooshed from Jim’s lungs.” You need to be careful when writing like this, though. If you overdo it, you risk plummeting into parody. In order to make action sequences more fast-paced for readers, write with shorter sentences and shorter paragraphs. Avoid excess description and focus on the action itself, almost to the exclusion of everything else. Picture what your characters are doing. Storyboard action sequences. Act them out if necessary (but not on real people, duh). I think the above says it all. Use action figures if you want or those small posable wooden models that artists use. Use toy cars, boats, guns, etc. Anything that will help you visually conceive of action moves and help you describe them more effectively. If nothing else, it'll give you an excuse to play with toys and act like a crazy person (as if writers need an excuse.) Next time you write an action sequence, try using some of the above tips, and you'll kick more ass and take more names than ever before.

EXERCISES

1. 

Take an action scene you've already written—or create a new one. Outline it using the Scene and Sequel technique to make it a sharper, faster-paced, more effective scene.

2. 

You can also take an action scene you admire from another writer’s story and outline it, looking for the Scene-and-Sequel pattern to see what makes it work so well.

3.

Create two characters with very different experiences/training in fighting who have very different goals for their fight scene. Write the scene to see how the differences between the characters impact their fight.

What's the best advice you can give to a beginning writer of horror/dark fantasy/suspense?

Stephen Graham Jones, award-winning editor of Best New Horror

1.

Engagement, investment. I mean, horror and dark fantasy and suspense are three things that share characteristics on the surface but have different engines powering them—kind of feel like "suspense" might arch over the other two, or be a component of them?—but, for all three, the reader has to identify at a level that engages them in the tension of the scene or situation, and then prompts or elicits or tricks them into “rooting” for this or that outcome, which is where investment comes in: we, the reader, want this or that to happen, we're invested in the outcome, we want the tension to resolve in X way, not Y way, please. And so we keep reading. And, of course, we only read about characters we can identify and engage with at some level or another. Otherwise they're alien to us, we don't grok their motivations or desires or whatever. Which, I'm not at all saying characters need to be likable or exactly relatable or even recognizable versions of ourselves, just that they need to be understandable by us, and in a way that resonates, a way that rings a chime in our chest, no matter how minor, that we can feel in our molars. So, step one, that kind of character. Step two, a situation that can go either way.

2.

If it doesn't scare you or make you tense or anxious, then how’s it supposed to get anybody to feel all of that?

Kenzie Jennings, author of Reception

1.

Horror writing should leave you with a feeling of dread, like the prickly, breathless unease you get when you're walking alone on a country road late at night, seeking out a lighted house or even an area on that stretch of road where you get one bar on your cell, anything at all, after your car breaks down, or even, sometimes, it's that hot, queasy sensation you get when you see a maggot-infested animal carcass on the side of that same road. Great horror has you feel that all over, and it may even keep you sleepless for a good while after.

2. 

Whatever's going on deep down inside, those personal demons plaguing you with their acid pox, use them to your advantage in your storytelling. Horror gives you absolute permission to let them out in whatever form you wish. That said, when you've finished, don't let them take charge of your voice, and don't let them leave a mess behind. Also, remember that you want readers to believe the story you write. To do that it must be grounded and to ground it you must be able to write about the world it's set in believably. If it's urban fantasy or horror set in our world, up your game by observing the world around you. We don't look, as much as we should. Look at ordinary things as if you've never seen them before. Look at people—strangers in a subway or a supermarket—as if you were a detective trying to figure them out. What clues can you pick up about their character? What makes a real-life scene vivid? What characterizes the real-world scene? What little details could be selected from the real world to include in grounding your fictional scene? Don't walk around in a haze—look at the world, make mental or written notes. Because the more real life you can include, in a terse and entertaining way, the more your reader will be drawn in, and the more they'll identify with the point-of-view character. The more they identify, the more control you have over their experience as a reader. Blending supernatural or powerful crime elements in with the real world you've evoked is itself a very necessary skill. Careful foreshadowing helps that a good deal.

Steve Rasnic Tem, award-winning author of Everything Is Fine Now

1. 

Authenticity. The subject matter of horror is fear, and in order to write good horror you have to have a good grasp of what people actually fear, what causes them anxiety, what causes them existential dread, and be able to create that experience in detail on the page. When horror stories fail, I believe they’re more likely to fail in their realism rather than in their fantasy. Your characters have to be fully realized and believable. Their fears have to be believable. And believable is not the same thing as explicit. All writers want to be creative and original, but sometimes it's tempting to push our horrific creations to the point where we’re writing about fears no one (including the writer) has ever felt. Your monsters can be as fantastic as you like, but the anxieties they inspire must be realistic and relatable.

2. 

It’s the same advice I would give to someone wanting to write effective fiction of any kind. You have to develop a good sense of what is possible in fiction and then personalize it. Embark on a reading program. Endeavor to read 1,000 short stories for a start—a variety of genres, sources, approaches. Study how the author began the story. Study how the author ended it. What was the strategy involved? How is the story structured? How did the author get from the beginning to the end, and how did that approach affect you as a reader? Was there a pattern involved, a series of connected incidents, rising and falling action, 3-act structure, etc.? Make notes. Make a collection of strategies for beginnings, middles, and ends. Relate these to the very personal stories you want to tell. One reason new writers struggle is because they don’t yet have a good grasp on what is possible in fiction.

Laird Barron, award-winning author of Worse Angels

1. 

Atmosphere. Setting and mood are vital, whether this is established early on, or gradually revealed to heighten tension and upend initial expectations.

2. 

As with most genres—close attention to characterization is vital. Reader empathy is more important than sympathy, but you'll take either.

CHAPTER NINETEEN

THERE ARE NO LIMITS, BUT . . .

Dear Sir or Madam:
I don't own a computer, and wouldn't know how to use one if I did, so I hope this letter reaches you. My name is _ and after a great deal of worrying and praying over a moral dilemma, I'm writing to ask for your help. I’m facing some very serious surgeries, so in Preparation for the hospital, I went to the store to buy new slippers, a robe, and a nightgown, and got a few paperback books to help pass the time and take my mind off my pain and fears. The store is small and hard for me to maneuver in my wheelchair, so I didn’t really examine the books—a crossword puzzle book, a comedy, and a spooky one. The spooky one says on the cover, "The best novel of the year. I can't recommend this novel highly enough." It's called Pandora Drive by Tim Waggoner, and is supposed to be about a young woman with psychic abilities, but it’s not really about her at all, and that's why I'm asking for your help. It was on a revolving rack right next to a Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books. I had no idea that it was so vile. The author's photo is on the inside, on the back cover with some information. He is a teacher at Sinclair Community College in Dayton, and there is something l sense from what he has written in this book that is so evil and so perverse and dangerous, that I am greatly concerned over the safety of his students, and everyone he may be in contact with. If you can obtain a copy of this book and read it, you'll understand what I'm trying to explain. It's not fair to judge someone by the way they look, but a person who can conceive of such evil thoughts, and expose impressionable students to them, might be a predator, a pedophile, and even worse. I don’t want to accuse an innocent person, but he may act on his thoughts and not be so innocent, and someone who is truly innocent may pay the price with their lives. Please, could you run a background check or whatever you can do, to find out if this man is dangerous to others? With all my heart, I hope and pray that what I feel about this man is wrong—that he just has a “warped” imagination—but if he's harmed someone, or will in the future, perhaps you can help, you can stop him before something truly terrible happens. He's too sure of himself! he can write such vile things and get away with it, no one will check, after all—he's a teacher— and that's a position of respect (or it used to be.) Maybe it's intuition, or fear, I don’t know how to explain what I feel when I look at the man's picture, but it's upset me so much that I'm Asking you, begging you, to please check into this matter. I apologize to you, and to him, if I've misjudged him, and pray for you (and his) forgiveness if I have, but if I ‘m right, maybe someone will be saved. Thank you for reading my letter, and for your time and help. May God bless you and your good work, and protect you and all those you love. 

The above letter was sent to the Dayton Police Department in December, 2009. They forwarded it to Sinclair Community College, where it ended up on the desk of my division dean at the time. The dean had a doctorate in theatre arts, and she well understood the difference between art and the artist and wasn’t unduly concerned. She told my chair about the letter, who in turn informed me. My first reaction was to laugh. Me? A danger to anyone? Why, as Norman's mother said, I wouldn't harm a fly. But seriously, I've never even been in a fight, never thrown a punch, not even to defend myself. I don't know if I'm even capable of violence. Yeah, I could be mean to my siblings when I was a kid (though my sister was much meaner and tougher than I was, and I'm still scared of her to this day), and there were times when my ex-wife and I were fighting that I yelled, and once I threw a TV remote against the wall and broke it. Once. And I still feel shame about that. As for being a pedophile, I have two daughters, four nephews, four grand-nephews and one grand-niece. The thought of anyone harming a child makes me ill. And corrupting the minds of my students? Most of them don't read for fun, and most of those that do don't read horror. And for those who do read horror . . , well, they often dig my stuff. Warped minds think alike, I suppose. And when I finally had the chance to read the letter itself, I got another laugh when I saw this line: “There is something l sense from what he has written in this book that is so evil and so perverse and dangerous, that I am greatly concerned over the safety of his students, and everyone he may be in contact with.” I mean, can you imagine a better blurb for a horror Writer? And the part of me that's a cynical salesman regrets that the media didn't get hold of this story and blow it up into a huge money-generating scandal for me. When I was a younger writer, I might have viewed this letter as a badge of honor. After all, one of the goals of horror writing is to make readers uncomfortable, to provoke, unsettle, and disturb. As John Trent says in John Carpenter‘s film In the Mouth of Madness: “People pay money to feel like that? It's cute. Put it in the press kit.” But this was an instance where someone reading my fiction was unsettled to the point of believing there was an actual threat in the real world. Kind of like a small-scale version of Orson Welles’ War of the Worlds broadcast. My words had such an impact on this woman that the line between fantasy and reality blurred for her—which is precisely what happens in Pandora Drive. So without realizing it, she had participated in a wonderfully bizarre meta-fictional experience—and had brought the Dayton police and my college’s administration in as well. (The best meta-fictional reading experience I ever had was when I read Joseph Heller’s Catch 22, and the paperback slowly fell apart in my hands as I read it.) I’m an older writer now, just as prone to overthink things as ever, but perhaps a bit more thoughtful and less self-centered when I do so. The worst thing artists can experience is indifference to their work. As Oscar Wilde said, “The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.“ The woman who wrote about Pandora Drive was definitely not indifferent to the book, and it certainly had an impact on her, although not perhaps the one I'd hoped for when I wrote it. I wrote the novel for horror fans and fans of bizarro fiction. I wanted to include every type of horror I could think of-quiet, loud, surreal, erotic, psychological, supernatural—and I wanted to include echoes of Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz. I also wanted to include a tribute to Richard Laymon, by including a Laymon-esque character whose repressed sexual desires were suddenly brought to dangerous life by my protagonist’s ability to manifest others’ fantasies. And—this is the last thing I’ll mention, I promise—I wanted to experiment with providing a false climax (no jokes, please), including what appeared to be a final conflict scene, only to have the story take off in a different direction afterward. (As you know by now, I firmly believe horror fiction shouldn't be safe, and that goes for narrative techniques authors use as well.) Remember how I said I overthink things? Point proven, I trust. I have artistic goals for everything I write, although I try not to call attention to them in my fiction. I want my stories to be fun and enjoyable but, if you’re interested in delving a little more deeply, there are other levels beyond entertainment to explore and, I hope, appreciate. I don’t expect everyone to like everything I create. Much of art appreciation comes down to personal taste. I hate raisins—they’re just the nasty little dried corpses of grapes—and I refuse to eat the damn things. But while I wonder a bit at the sanity of those who eat raisins, let alone love them, I know raisins are what they are. They never change. Only the people eating them do. But the woman who responded so strongly to Pandora Drive didn't simply dislike horror fiction. She was profoundly, deeply disturbed by my words, ideas, and images. Perhaps even to the point of being traumatized—and right before she was scheduled for multiple surgeries. I know she's responsible for her own choices as a reader. (Why she kept reading when she found the book was, to put it mildly, not to her taste, I'll never understand.) But I'm also not so naive as to think that my work has no consequences in the real world. Some writers decry the use of genre labels, obvious genre covers, and genre-identifiable back cover copy, feeling that such things diminish the seriousness with which their work should be taken or begin to shape readers’ response to the work before they've even begun to read it. I understand those points and don’t necessarily disagree with them. But I don't mind labels and packaging. They let people know whether a work of art may or may not be for them. The Letter Woman was hurt by reading my work. Perhaps she hurt herself, but I made the knife she cut herself with, so to speak. And I've made a lot of other knives since then, large and small, some sharper than others. I suppose it’s inevitable that when you make knives, someone’s eventually going to get cut. But that doesn't mean I like it or that it's always easy to live with. That woman did me a huge favor. She reminded me that if I'm going to make knives, I need to do so responsibly, always remaining aware that there's a person who will one day grasp the handle, pick it up, and attempt to use it. She reminded me that, as it says in theme to the old cartoon Super Chicken: “You knew the job was dangerous when you took it.” When it comes to horror fiction—and I suspect art in general—Clive Barker famously said, “There are no limits." (Hence the title for this chapter.) In the abstract, this is true. But that doesn't mean individual artists don't have their own limits, or that different projects don‘t require different limits. I would never write something even remotely like Pandora Drive if I was writing for kids. Do I believe in censorship? Of course not. Do I believe in self-restraint when it comes to writing? Only if it helps me tell the best story I can. But that means I also believe in a total lack of restraint if that's what a story requires. Do I always toss in as much sex, violence, weird ideas, and bizarre imagery into my horror fiction as possible? Nope. Do I give my imagination free reign to go where it will while at the same time keeping my readers in mind? You bet. These days, however, I consider my artistic choices—and their potential impact—a bit more carefully. And I think all horror writers should do the same. Bottom line: Respect the knife and the eventual wielder of it, but always make the sharpest goddamned blade you can.

EXERCISES

1. 

Write about your attitude/reaction toward violent/extreme content in fiction—both your own fiction and that written by others. Do you have any limits? If so, what are they? Are there any lines you simply will not cross, no matter what?

2. 

If you've identified a type of content you aren't comfortable writing in your fiction—such as a detailed scene of torture (whether physical or psychological), for example—write a scene using this content. Try to find your way of approaching it, whether that means leading up to the scene but cutting away before things get too nasty, or finding different ways to detail the experience (for example, remaining in the mind of a character who's trying to mentally escape being tortured) that are different than merely cataloging atrocities.

3. 

If you normally write extreme horror, create a grisly scene (or take one you've already written and revise it) using subtlety and suggestion instead of graphic detail. Do you think this scene is stronger or weaker for its use of restraint? Why?

VOICES FROM THE SHADOWS

1. 

What makes good horror/dark fantasy/suspense?

2. 

What's the best advice you can give to a beginning writer of horror/dark fantasy/suspense?

Kaaron Warren, award-winning author of Into Bones Like Oil

1. 

Good horror taps into our basic human instincts: disgust, unease, fear, avoidance. Those things are about staying alive, about avoiding the things that might kill us. Good horror looks death in the face.

2. 

Some people say to write about the dark side of life, you need to be immune to it.I say the opposite. It's only by being deeply affected by the world around me that I can write stories that have any value. I'm afraid of the dark, large crowds, mold spores, confined spaces, violence, unpredictability, loss, viciousness, a lack of kindness. I'm afraid of the world my children will have to live with. Be brave. Go to that place you think you shouldn't go. Don't hold back.

William Meikle, author of the S-Squad series

1. 

The short answer is, “I know it when I see it." The long answer is a bit more complicated. It's that raising of the hackles at the back of your neck, a soft kiss in an empty room, the whisper in the dark in the castle ruins . . . if an author can recreate that feeling they've done their job. There's also of course the raising of other emotions, things like disgust, awe, wonder, guilt and fear of the other. But for me it all starts with the simple things and stems from a base emotion . . . dread.

2. 

You need the ability to tap into what scares other people, not just what scares you, the writer, because everybody is scared of different things. So go back to basics to start with primitive fears that a lot of people share, like fear of the dark, or fear of creepy crawlies. Take the base idea, give it a twist, and make it your own. And if that doesn’t work, take another base idea, rinse and repeat.

Priya Sharma, award-winning author of All the Fabulous Beasts

1. 

Good horror, like any other type of fiction, is underpinned by good writing with regards to plot, structure, characterization, dialogue and setting. As to the horror element, what's good is subjective. For me, it's when a writer reveals the darkness within us and in the everyday. I love atmosphere and slow-building dread. I love suggestions rather than explicitness, although there are times when the latter has its place. I love it when a writer brings a new perspective to something.

2.

Let the horror serve the story, not the story serve the horror elements. Write the sort of horror you want to read. Write what you believe in. Don't follow fashion. So many fears are universal, so don't be afraid to bring your own strangeness to the page. It took me a long time to realize that my inner freak is an ally and an asset. Play. Write without self-consciousness or self-censorship. You can clear it up your manuscript in the later redrafts.

Jayaprakash Satyamurthy, author of Weird Tales of a Bungalorean

1.

There's no singular answer to this. As a suspense novel, Rogue Male by Geoffrey Household succeeds because of its unrelenting intensity and stoic, almost minimalist narration. John Le Carre’s novels on the other hand, are complex, filled with characters and nuances, and work just as well. It seems to me what matters are craft and a kind of sincerity—a sense that the plot serves the underlying themes and artistic unity, and is not just a box of tricks.

2.

I suppose in a way the answer to this question is contained in the answer to the first one, but I'd add: be yourself. Fear and wonder are personal emotions, but we can communicate them to others if we are true to what scares, haunts or fascinates us. Don't worry about what the most popular horror films or the genre bestsellers are working off. Find what moves you and start from there.

CHAPTER TWENTY

THE EVIL SPREADS

As I've said a few times before, this book isn’t designed to cover everything there is to know about writing fiction. So this chapter—which deals with ways of marketing yourself and your work in the field of horror—doesn’t cover everything about the nuts and bolts of marketing in either traditional or indie publishing. There are tons of books, articles, and videos out there to give you that information. Just make sure the person giving you the advice speaks from experience—and from experience you respect. There are a lot of newly published or barely published writers trying to make coin by selling their how-to’s to other writers. And there are a lot of writers who don't realize how inexperienced they are when they try to tell others how it's done (and they don’t have a clue themselves). It only takes a couple minutes to check a writer's credentials to verify if they're someone you think has solid information to offer. One book I recommend—and which I use as textbook in my classes—is Jane Friedman’s The Business of Being a Writer. Friedman specializes in up-to-the minute knowledge of all things relating to the business of writing, and anything she writes on the subject is well worth checking out. Visit her website (you'll find the link on the resources list in Appendix F) and sign up for her newsletter. You won't regret it. Okay, let’s talk about branding. Branded. Not long ago I was at a con, and I overhead two writer friends talking. One remarked to the other about how well dressed he was that day, and he replied, “A.B.B. Always Be Branding." He meant it at least partially as a joke, poking fun at business’ gurus near obsession with branding, but there was some truth to his words as well. Years back, I read an article Dean Koontz published in Writer's Digest in which he said the only thing writers truly have to sell is their unique vision, what makes them them. Back then, branding wasn't something writers spoke about—at least, not like we do currently—but that's what Koontz was talking about. And in this day, when thousands upon thousands of traditionally published and indie writers compete for readers, having a strong brand can help you stand out from the crowd and cut through all the marketing white noise that readers are constantly bombarded with. So, what the hell is a brand? Despite business types’ never-ending attempts to define brand, it's a slippery, imprecise term, much like when literary types talk about a writer's voice, although in many ways they’re the same thing. One’s a business view of the concept, the other is an artistic view. A brand is not simply a description of the product you’re offering, but of the experience. For example, someone could say that Richard Laymon (especially in his earlier novels) wrote fast-paced extreme horror. Or for another example, Caitlin R. Kiernan writes literary character-centered dark fantasy. These two examples describe both the products the authors create as well as the experience readers have when they consume (read) those products. It's not enough for us to say, "I’m a good writer and my stories are good.” This gives readers no clear indication of what you and your work are like. More, there’s nothing that stands out about it. In “Your Guide to Branding Yourself as an Author," the NY Book Editors quote Amazon's Jeff Bezos as saying, “A brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room." A brand is what you're known for, and what you want to be known for going forward. DO you need a brand? It depends on your career goals. If you view yourself primarily as an artist, producing work for its own sake, and you don't care how many readers your work ultimately reaches, then no, you don't need a brand. Put your work out into the world, and let it sink or swim on its own merits. There's not a damn thing wrong with this approach, so long as it’s what you want. But if you want to connect to and—more importantly—grow an audience, build a reputation for yourself, and maybe make some money in the process, branding is essential. And branding isn't only about reaching readers. If you’re a traditionally published writer, branding is an effective way to market yourself to agents and editors—especially in a pitch meeting where you don't have much time to sell yourself and your work. If you say, “I write dark thrillers set in the Pacific Northwest," agents and editors will know exactly what you're bringing to the table. Basic elements of branding. In order to start figuring out your brand, you'll need to look at a few things.

- The genre you write in. Because you’re reading this book, I'm assuming you’re a horror writer. But maybe you consider yourself a thriller or suspense writer (genres I consider to be horror-adjacent).

- The subgenre you write in. In other words, what flavor of horror do you write? Quiet, extreme, erotic, gothic, literary, dark fantasy, Lovecraftian, weird, science fiction horror, creature-feature? Or the more horror-flavored versions of thriller and suspense: dark crime, dark thriller, dark suspense?

- Specific qualities your writing has. What typifies your writing in terms of style and subject matter? Is it fast-paced? Do you write strong characters? Action-packed scenes? Do you create an atmosphere of creeping menace? Is your fiction intricately plotted? Your prose lyrical and evocative? Is it set in a specific region? Do you tend to write about working class people, oddballs and misfits, everyday men and women, or demented psychopaths? Are there any particular themes your work tends to focus on? Families in crisis, people struggling to survive in a hostile environment, civilized people forced by circumstance to behave in very uncivilized ways, etc.?

- Credentials. Are you a well—published veteran writer? An exciting new voice in the field? An award—winner? A skilled craftsperson? Do you have any non-writing background details that might help brand your writing? For example, if you write military horror, having been in the service is an important credential. It’s the same if you write medical horror and work in the healthcare field. Any of the above elements can help form your brand. For example, “Ms. Darkscribe is an award-winning author of extreme horror dealing with the power dynamics between men and women." 

Techniques for branding. Here are some useful practices for developing your brand:

List three words that best describe your work. (I got this technique from Kristine Kathryn Rusch’s book Creating Your Author Brand.) The words I came up with to describe the kind of horror I write are dark fantasy, surreal, and existential. (Yes, I know dark fantasy is two words. Bite me). With a little work, these three qualities can be blended into a single branding statement: I write nightmarish dark fantasy dealing with the horrors of existence. What makes you different from everyone else? I like to write horror fiction that blurs the line between reality and fantasy, between the inner world and the outer world. What's different about you and your work? What do others—readers, reviewers, editors, agents, other writers—say about your work? The horrors of existence line I used above? It was inspired by an Amazon review of one of my books: "I appreciate Waggoner as a master of nuance, subtlety, and the slow build of dread in stories that showcase the horror of existence.” That's practically a branding statement in itself! I got this from a FEAR-net review; “Tim Waggoner manages to meld surreal imagery and events with strong character work and an immersive point of view, resulting in work that shocks you on the surface and unsettles you right down to your bones." Again, almost a ready-made branding statement. Writer Lawrence C. Connelly once told me that “the world will decide how we'll be remembered.” The world’s perception of you and your work can also help you consciously develop your brand. Create a one-sentence tag (or a short phrase) for you and your work. John F.D. Taft labels himself “Modern Horror’s King of Pain.” In a blurb, Richard Laymon referred to Edward Lee as “The Living Legend of Literary Mayhem.” A reviewer on Dayton.com once referred to me as “Stephen King Meets Franz Kafka,” a description I use on my website. Sometimes your most famous (or infamous) work can become your tag, as in “Jack Ketchum, author of The Girl Next Door” or Anne (Interview with the Vampire) Rice. According to reviewers, Dean Koontz writes “edge-of-your seat thrillers.” Author Gary McMahon called Caitlin R. Kiernan “one of the great stylists of horror fiction." Lucy Taylor has been called “The Queen of Erotic Horror." If you're just starting out as a writer and feel uncomfortable calling yourself Master, King, Queen, Legend, etc., I don't blame you. I'm a midwestern boy, and where I come from, we’re taught that bragging is unseemly. And you'll probably make yourself look ridiculous claiming your horror royalty right out of the gate. How many new horror writers have come on the scene proclaiming themselves to be “The Next Stephen King,” only to fade away after a short time? But you can start out calling yourself “Author of Erotic Horror" or “Creator of Literary Mayhem" until such time as you feel you've earned a loftier title—or better yet, have such a title bestowed on you by someone else. Provide a consistent experience in your work. Consistent in terms of content and quality, yes, but most importantly, in terms of reader experience. If you're a writer who enjoys working in different genres, or telling different types of stories within the same genre, you can still provide a consistent experience from the quality of your writing. Readers need to feel confident that they will get the same experience whenever they read one of your stories. You don't want to write the same basic story over and over, but you do want readers to feel the same after they finish reading one. Provide a consistent presentation across various platforms: your writing, your website, your social media presence, your presence at conferences and workshops, etc. This doesn’t mean that if you're an extreme horror writer, you have to talk about blood and guts all the time, and it doesn't mean you have to dress in spiked leather outfits and carry a chainsaw when at a con (although you can if you want—no judgment on my part). But I wouldn't dress in bright colors and act all Pollyanna-ish on social media either. Your website, your card, your promotional materials should all present a feeling of “extreme horror” (or whatever subgenre you write) in terms of color, imagery, and text. And having a consistent logo for your name to put on all your materials is another useful branding tool. What you wear during personal appearances and in photos matters, too. Author Michael West is known for wearing black horror-movie T-shirts, Jonathan Maberry often wears Hawaiian shirts, and I wear what I call my “stupid author branding hat.”

- Changing brands. Most authors don’t just love one genre. I love horror most (all kinds), but I also love fantasy, science fiction, thrillers, suspense, and mysteries. Sometimes as authors experiment over the years, they find themselves becoming successful in genres different than the ones they started out in. Tom Piccirilli wrote horror, westerns, and mysteries before finally focusing on noir. Alexandra Sokolofi started out writing horror and now writes thrillers about FBI agents. Past HWA president Deborah LeBlanc now writes paranormal romances for Harlequin’s Nocturne line. Simon Wood started out with horror and now is a highly successful thriller writer. You’re not stuck being just one thing your entire creative life. But when you switch genres, it might take a while to rebrand yourself. I’m known for writing horror and media tie-ins. I consider myself a horror writer who also does tie-ins, and it helps that the majority of my tie-ins have been horror-related (novels based on Supernatural, Alien, A Nightmare on Elm Street, etc.). If, for whatever reason, I decided to focus on tie-in writing to the exclusion of all else, I'd rebrand myself as solely a media tie-in writer, an expert at telling stories in other people's worlds. (Don't worry. I have no plans to abandon horror!) Maintaining separate brands. Some writers who write in different genres use a different name for the different types of books they write. These pseudonyms may be secret or not, but the idea is to give books a label that easily identifies them. So Kristine Kathyrn Rusch writes science fiction as Kristine Kathryn Rusch, paranormal romance as Kristine Grayson, and mystery as Kris Nellscot. Western writer Peter Brandvold writes darker, more violent westerns as Frank Leslie. Neither of these writers hide their true identities. Their pseudonyms simply brand the different kinds of books they write. People don't buy products—they buy products from people they like. In many ways—maybe the most important—you are your brand. The way you present yourself on social media and how you interact with people during personal appearances at cons, signings, workshops, etc., tells them whether or not they like you. And if they don’t like you, they won’t buy your work, no matter how brilliant it is. There are exceptions, of course, but most readers would rather spend their money to support someone they like. So bottom line: Don’t be an asshole. Or to put it less bluntly, try to be the best version of yourself when doing business. And remember that no matter what you do, you're always branding. Play the long game. Brands don't happen right away. You can't a create a social media profile, label yourself “The New Messiah of Horror" and expect to become a bestseller overnight. A brand is a cumulation of many different things, some large, some small, some consciously chosen, some occurring organically. A brand takes time to develop. Be patient. The good news about this is if you make mistakes along the way, there’s plenty of time to make any needed course corrections. Branding can take a lot of work if you want to do it right, but the beauty of it is you can do as much or as little of it as you like or have time for. You might feel like you’re being fake at first, putting a persona out into the world that isn't really you. I understand that, but I try to think of it as putting out a curated version of my true self, the same way that I have a teacher persona when I'm in the classroom versus when I'm at home being a husband and father. They're all aspects of me, all real, but I use them for different purposes at different times. So get out there, and remember: A.B.B.! Network smarter, not harder. It's not what you know, it's who you know. That bit of conventional “wisdom” is often cited by writers to explain everything from rejection letters to the lousy state of publishing. It’s not my fault, they think. It's the publishing good-old-boy network keeping me out.  There's no denying that networking is important—perhaps even vital—in creating a writing career. But too many people hold a narrow view of what networking is. They imagine standing around at a publisher’s party at a conference, free drink in hand, schmoozing with editors and agents, regaling them with wit and wowing them with a verbal description of their latest (planned but not yet written) 300-thousand-word opus. But in its purest sense, networking is simply about making connections, and you don't have to be a mainstay of the New York publishing scene to do it effectively. One of the first ways that writers can start making connections is by taking classes. Creative writing classes are offered through colleges and universities, of course, but they are also sponsored by adult continuing education programs, libraries and local arts organizations. Taking a creative writing class can provide an excellent opportunity for feedback from a (hopefully) skilled instructor, and from other student writers. But it can also provide the beginnings of a writer's network. Your instructor will be able to point you toward resources—reference books, writing programs and conferences in your area—which can, if nothing else, decrease your writing-career learning curve. Your instructor should be able to give you advice on publishing, perhaps even provide you with some contacts. But the truth is that many creative writing courses are staffed by instructors who've published little, if at all. Always try to learn something about an instructor’s credentials if you can before signing up for a class. Ask to see a bibliography of the instructor's published works and try to track down and read some of them. Caveat emptor. But even if the instructor is far from a bestselling author, that doesn't matter much. Because the most important networking opportunity is the chance to hook up with you.r fellow students. From creative writing classes, writers’ groups are born—groups which can continue providing feedback on your work long after the class ends; groups which also can pool their knowledge of marketing and submission strategies. But what if there aren't any creative writing classes offered in your area? How can you establish a writers’ group then? By advertising, naturally. Put up notices in libraries, bookstores, and coffee shops, and post on your social media sites: WANTED: ONE WRITERS’ GROUP. Author readings and signings are other excellent networking opportunities. You might be able to chat with the author for a bit and ask questions. Maybe even more than a bit since signings and readings are notorious for being poorly attended. You may well have the author all to yourself. You can also meet other beginning writers. Take a notebook with you and, at an appropriate time, announce you'd like to form a writers’ group and pass the notebook around for interested parties to write down their addresses and phone numbers. You can also pass out business cards if you have some (and you should). You can take classes online and connect with other writers via social media. You can exchange stories for critique through e-mail and of course share those all-important marketing tips. Author webpages are also wonderful resources. Not only do authors sometimes post articles on how they got started or offer advice to newcomers, they often provide their e-mail addresses. Got a question or two? Go ahead and e-mail an author, though don't be surprised if he or she’s too busy to respond. And don’t bombard them with “Where’s my reply?" follow-ups. Annoying people is not an effective networking strategy. Writers’ organizations are also great networking resources. Often, you need to have only one pro story sale under your belt to join as an affiliate member. You won't be able to vote in officer elections or for awards, but you'll be entitled to receive the organization's publications, such as handbooks, newsletters, access to members-only sections of the organizations message boards, and directories of members (with those handy e-mail addresses). Even if you haven't made a pro sale yet and don't qualify for membership, you can still often purchase and subscribe to an organization's publications. Conferences and conventions are prime networking opportunities. Not only can you attend workshops and informative panels on writing, but you can often speak with program participants—authors, editors and agents—in the hall after a panel or at other slow times during a conference. Come prepared with questions and always bring along a manuscript or two. Never thrust your work upon someone, though. Always wait to be asked. You can also become a program participant yourself with only a few sales to your credit. I began sitting in on panels at conventions after only having sold a handful of stories. All I did was write the conference's director of programming, introduce myself as a local writer, list my credits, and relate my desire to be on a few panels. My first convention as a program participant made all the difference in my career. Not only did the other writers see me more as a peer, I was able to hook up with a writers‘ group which counted several published novelists among its members. I can't begin to tell you how much I learned from them, and far more important, I made some great friends. And that's what networking is all about, really. Not cold-bloodedly using other human beings to advance your career. But making connections, making friends. Good writing happens when good people get together. Good careers can happen, too. The anthology game. Many writers believe that the short story, while as vital as ever as an art form, is past its publishing prime. The days when large circulation glossy magazines routinely ran short fiction are long gone, and while there are still plenty of small- press journals and magazines around, many have a print run of only a few thousand copies, if that. Sure, it seems like there's a new webzine popping up on the Internet every nanosecond or two, but the quality of such publications varies wildly, and usually they don't pay—not even in copies. But there is a market for short fiction that not only pays and has a decent circulation, it also has a longer shelf life than most magazines and journals. I'm talking about theme anthologies. Theme anthologies are book-length collections of short fiction (although sometimes poetry is included as well) centered around a particular theme. Among the anthologies I've had stories published in over the years are such diverse titles—and themes—as Villains Victorious, Civil War Fantastic, Tails of Terror, Never Fear—the Tarot, and (perhaps the weirdest of all) Alien Pets. The idea is that the theme will be an effective marketing hook, and for this reason, many writers are cynical about these anthologies, feeling that the themes constrain creativity and don't lead to a writer's best work. But in a very real sense, the various “Year's Best" anthologies center around a theme as well: the best work (stories, essays, poems, etc.) published in a given year. Besides being a good business tool, a theme can be a lot of fun for writers to work with. It can provide structure and spark ideas, in the same way that a poet might be challenged by attempting to write a sonnet or sestina. Whenever I start a story for a new anthology, I always ask myself the same question: How in the world am I going to write a story about that? (Remember Alien Pets?) I find the challenge invigorating, and sometimes frustrating, but always fun. To market, to market. So let's say you want to try your hand at writing a story for a theme anthology. How do you find markets to submit to? It’s not always easy; some anthologies are invitation-only, meaning the editor contacts specific writers and asks them to submit stories. But there are anthologies that are open to any writers, and you can find their submission information listed in writers’ magazines—like Writer’s Digest, of course—and often the same information is available on these magazines’ websites. Various writers’ organizations supply market information to their members, but even if you don't yet have the credentials to join, you can often subscribe to their newsletters or market publications. The Horror Writers’ Association's newsletter always contains market information, as does the Bulletin of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. Often, various writing-related Websites, sometimes affiliated with professional writers’ organizations, sometimes not, will have message boards where people post market information. And if you follow publishers on social media, you’ll see any public submission calls they may make. Even if an anthology is by invitation only, you might still be able to submit to it. Read and research published anthologies and compile a list of editors‘ names. These editors attend a number of writers’ conferences throughout the year. If you find yourself at the same conference, go up and introduce yourself and ask if the editor has any open anthology projects that you might be able to submit to. If you can’t attend such conferences, you might be able to track down editors‘ e-mail addresses—especially if you are a member of a writers’ organization with access to other members’ contact information. Send a short, polite e-mail inquiring if the editor has any open projects you can submit to. You'll be surprised how often an editor is willing to look (on spec) at a story for a supposedly “closed” anthology. An idea is worth a (few) thousand words. So, after diligent research and perhaps a little networking, you've discovered an anthology you'd like to submit to. How do you come up with a story idea? First, remember that your story must center on the anthology‘s theme. Sometimes these themes can be broad—Love, Friendship, Revenge, etc.—and sometimes they can be very specific. I've done stories for anthologies based on TV shows like X-Files and role-playing games like Warhammer 40K where the guidelines are very clear on what the editors expect and what writers can and can't do with the characters and concepts. Whatever the theme, broad or narrow, your story needs to add to the anthology’s exploration of it while at the same time avoiding covering the same ground as all the other stories. For example, the anthology Blood Type featured vampire stories. I knew I had to avoid the same basic vampire-story ideas that all the other writers would come up with, so I flipped the concept of the vampire on its head. In my story "Sun Hungry," the sun itself is a vampiric entity that feeds on the lives of every creature on Earth, which is why we age and die. For another vampire anthology, Vampires Don’t Sparkle—which featured stories about evil predatory vampires instead of sensitive eternal teenagers— I once again went for something different. What would be more evil than a vampire preying on humans? A vampire that preys on other vampires, I decided. I titled that story “What Once was Flesh.“ Something else I did for those stories was to make them even more “Tim Waggoner" stories by using things I observed in real life. For “Sun Hungry," I used a man I’d seen for years walking on the sidewalk during the day. He usually carried a full brown paper grocery sack, and his body was almost completely covered. Jeans, hoodie (with the hood up), gloves, and sunglasses. The gentleman likely had a skin condition of some kind, and I always admired how he went out in daylight4even in summer—knowing that some people might find his appearance odd. The man in the hoodie added to the idea of a vampiric sun equaled a story combination that no one else on Earth but me could’ve created. For “What Once was Flesh," I used a medical transport vehicle from a private company that I observed sitting in the parking lot of a Barnes and Noble several days in a row. I found it strange that the drivers were never out actually helping anyone or delivering patients to hospitals. I decided the vehicle was a cover for a pair of vampires, one of whom took new vampires under his wing, taught them how to kill, and then after they fed on their first victim—under his supervision—he killed and drained them. Not only did he get a gourmet meal (human blood combined with vampire blood) he eliminated any potential competition. A vampire who preys on other vampires added to the strange medical transport van equaled another story only I could’ve written. I'd been invited by the editor of both anthologies to submit stories, but if I hadn’t done a good job on those stories, the editors still would have rejected them. But by using my simple formula—a twist on the theme combined with something weird I observed —the stories were more likely to be accepted because they weren't the same kind of thing anyone else could write. While getting a story published (and receiving a check to cash) is nice, the main reward of writing for themed anthologies for me is that I've written stories I never would have otherwise (need I mention Alien Pets again?), and they've often turned out to be some of the best work I’ve done. The themes have not only sparked ideas, they've taken me in directions I never would have explored otherwise and helped me grow as a writer. And they can do the same for you.

EXERCISES

1. 

Choose three words that describe the kind of fiction you write. If you have any professional reviews of your work or reader reviews, see if you can pull some descriptive words about your work from them. Avoid using horror as one of the three words.

2. 

What images would you associate with your brand? Try to avoid such standard horror icons as skulls, bats, ghosts, etc. (unless you can come up with a really cool arid unique spin on the image). List three. Which one do you think would look best on a business card or a website?

3.

Write a slogan for yourself, a short phrase or single sentence. Write it as a piece of advertising, highlighting—but not over-exaggerating—the positive qualities of your writing. Imagine you're a publicity specialist hired to write this slogan.

Andrew Neiderman, bestselling author of The Girl in the Painting

1. 

Surprise. Always look at what others might fail to see. Credibility. Even if you're writing a fantasy, you need to steep it in reality so the reader will accept your leaps.

2. 

My best advice is and always has been: read, read, read. See what others have done. You'll find someone who will inspire you to do something original. Good luck.

Angela Yuriko Smith, author of Bitter Suites

1. 

Good horror requires empathy on the part of the writer. We have to be able to understand not only our reader, but our characters. It's one thing to write around a serial killer, but effective horror will channel the killer. The writer will understand the motivations for horrible deeds and sympathize with the motivation. On some level, we will agree with our monsters if we want to effectively communicate them. Without empathy, we are cataloging details. With it, we create life for our readers.

2. 

Stay out of the way. We are a background character in our work. Like the puppeteer, everyone knows we are there but if they see us the magic is lost. The characters know what they want. We can suggest and guide, but the best characters have a life of their own. When we keep our opinions, moralities and judgment off the page (even though it's still working in the background) we wind up creating something independent that breathes on its own. If we don't, we wind up with a story that depends on life support to stay alive.

Dacre Stoker, co-author of Dracul

1.

I take my lead from my great grand uncle, Bram Stoker, who, in his novel Dracula, and actually in many of his other novels as well, made the stories feel real. He created a “willful suspension of disbelief” for his readers which can be very powerful. I write primarily about vampires; therefore one of my goals is to convince my readers that the presence of the supernatural in the natural world is a very good possibility. Blending into the story real events, real people and places help lull the reader into a place where it is difficult to discern which parts are fact and which parts are fiction.

2.

Read other people's work, watch movies and streaming shows in the horror/suspense genre to get a sense of what you think works and is effective at creating horror and suspense. Use this background research to develop your own style that conveys a similar message. Explore different ways to tell the story using both traditional and non—traditional plotlines: epistolary, flashbacks, flash-forwards. Don't spoon feed the reader, allow them to relax at times then put them into stressful situations, keep them on edge.

The storytelling! A great story and the Storyteller can hook you from the very first few lines. If you don't have a great story nothing else will work that well. Have you ever seen a movie and heard the reviewers say the acting and characters were amazing, but the story went nowhere? That’s true with any medium. You have to have a great foundation. Don't get me wrong, amazing characters are also important. Of course none of it is possible without great writing.

2. 

This is a hard one. There is no magic bullet and there is so much great advice out there one should know. I would say if writing horror is your dream or goal, DO IT! Just start doing it. Sit down right now, start writing down your ideas. Grow those ideas to stories. If you don't start, you're never going to get there. No matter what never give up! That is very important.

END OF THE LINE

So what's the best way to end a book like this? I could do my best to say something encouraging that will leave you feeling inspired, ready to write and take the horror world by storm. I could sound a cautionary note about how you shouldn't take anything in this book—from me or from all the wonderful writers and editors who were kind enough to whisper at us from the shadows where they lurk-as gospel. (And a dark gospel, at that.) I could tell you to use this book as a jumping-off point, a resource for ideas, techniques, and advice to mull over, try on for size, and then use to help you find your own way, whether that means adopting some of the practices I've written about or saying This idiot has no idea what he’: talking about and charting your own course. If this book helps you in any way, I'll consider it a success. I could tell you that by writing horror, you're contributing to one of the oldest and most powerful forms of literature our species has ever produced. And I could tell you that by doing so you're part of a community of writers who, in many ways, are family. But I don't want you to think about yourself. I want you to think about those who come after you. You've probably heard the phrase pay it forward before. If not, it's the concept that since you can't pay back people who helped you along the way in your career, you should help others who are just starting out—or who are a few rungs below you on the ladder of success. You might think such a sentiment is nice, but it's really an ideal that's talked about more than actually practiced. Maybe that's true in some professions, but in the horror community, paying it forward is one of our bedrock principles. We believe in it— deeply—and we do it every damn day, in ways large and small. One of the reasons for this is that we know what it's like to be the weird kid (and the weird teenager and the weird adult . . .) We know what it's like to love the dark, the bizarre, the disturbing. We know what it's like to have other people look at us and wonder —whether silently or aloud—What's wrong with you? So when we're lucky enough to find each other, it's like meeting a long-lost member of an extended family. You're one of us, and we're one of you, and it's all of us against the whole damn world. We stick up for one another, fight for one another, love one another. We take care of our own—especially our young. (Young in terms of writing craft if not age, young in terms of writing horror if you've been writing in another genre, young in terms of connecting to the community after years of writing on your own for so long.) So once you've finished this book, I want you to make your own unique and special contributions to our field. Write great stuff! Participate in online horror communities, get together with other members of our weird tribe—join or start a writers group—learn from each other, support each other, go to conventions, speak on panels, conduct workshops, teach classes, mentor other writers, give them advice, give them blurbs, share their troubles, tell them what you've learned so they can add it to what they already know and keep going. Be a good citizen of your literary community. Pay it forward. I wish you a good, long, productive life in horror. And I hope it's a scary one.

What's the best advice you can give to a beginning writer of horror/dark fantasy/suspense?

Christopher Golden, bestselling author of The Pandora Roam

1. 

Humanity is the core of good horror. Revulsion is different, in my mind. Anyone can write something revolting. But good horror comes when an author can weave an emotional connection between reader and character. If the writer can set that hook deep enough, when she reels it in, she can rip your goddamn heart out.

2. 

Same answer, my friend. Same answer.

Jeffrey Thomas, author of The Endless Fall and Other Weird Fictions

1.

Though our own personal buttons might vary, from reader to reader, in terms of what gets to us, there's a reason why so many people fear the same kinds of things. There's that universal, primal, caveman stuff: fear of the dark, fear of the things that move in the dark, fear of the forever dark that comes with the extinguishment of life. Fear of the unknown, which is what the dark actually represents. Ultimately, though, a writer can easily enough understand this kind of instinctual fear—there’s really no great revelation in it—but then we need the real magic: the effective writer's ability to activate those ingrained anxieties; to immerse the reader, make them feel like a participant instead of just an observer. If you can make the reader feel they're venturing into the dark when they're reading in a sunlit room, make them feel endangered when they're snuggled up in a cozy blanket, then you're doing good work.

2.

Open wide your sensitivities, to the world and to yourself. Pay attention to what frightens others, whether it be the fiction that has come before your own, or today's headlines. And pay attention to your own anxieties. Use what you observe and personally experience as raw material. You may not only find this process therapeutic, in some way, but make it therapeutic for your readers, as well.

Marc Gascoigne, publisher and editor

1.

I'm not a fan of the unrealistic, the fantastical, it’s silly. The horror that gets me shivering is the portrayal of a genuine, everyday threat. As father to two teenagers, a threat to someone I love and whom I'm supposed to protect is the scariest threat of all, especially if there's nothing I can do to stop it. See Thomas Ligotti’s “The Frolic” for one superb example of what actually keeps someone like me awake at night.

2. 

Have characters REACT to what happens. Hollywood's instilled in us the lie that rugged heroes and sassy heroines can shrug off damage, both physical and mental, as if it were nothing. Elsewhere, characters cheerfully learn that all the known laws of the universe are wrong, magic and the supernatural are real, and get on with their day as if nothing happened. This is utter bullshit. As an editor, the thing I find myself shouting more than anything when reading a below-par draft of a book is always along the lines of “Goddammit [author], his best friend in all the world, who he's known since they were little kids, just turned into human mush and slipped messily clown through a sewer grate—have him show at least a flicker of emotion there before he starts the next boring fist fight. Please."

Kate Jonez, chief editor, Omnium Gatherum

1. 

The best horror of all has the element of surprise. Stories can be adequately scary even if we know what’s coming. But the very best of the best twist when you expect a turn. There is no greater pleasure than encountering something unexpected.

2. 

The most effective technique I've found for writing horror is used most frequently in acting. Find a moment when you experienced (or did) something truly shocking and horrifying. Remember a personal tragedy or something that shook your world apart. Be brave when you face it. Never be kind or shy away from the horror. Tell the truth about the feelings. Live with it and turn it over and over—then write it down.

APPENDIX A

AUTOPSY

As I was writing this book, I asked myself what would be an effective way to show principles of good horror writing being applied. The answer came easily enough: critique a horror story, analyze it, discuss its strengths and weaknesses, and suggest possible revisions. The same kind of thing I do in creative writing classes all the time. I didn’t want to use someone else’s story, though. Even if they volunteered to have it critiqued in print, I wouldn't feel comfortable doing so and I'd probably hold back when critiquing it, at least a little. I toyed with writing a purposely bad story to critique, but I quickly decided against it. Such a story would likely end up a parody—whether I meant it to or not—and it wouldn't demonstrate the real issues a story written by a beginning writer would have. Then it came to me. I was a beginning writer once. Maybe I could critique one of my old stories. I still have quite a few hard copies of stories, novels, and partials that I produced in my late teens/early twenties. Maybe I could use one of those. I decided to look for one of the earliest horror stories I ever wrote—perhaps the earliest—a tale with the brilliantly original title of "Scary Christmas." It took some digging through my vast archive (okay, though several cardboard boxes and plastic storage containers), but I found it, and I now present it to you in all its glory. A few words about “Scary Christmas" before you read it. I wrote it when I was eighteen or nineteen, so we're talking the end of 1982 or the beginning of 1983. It was my freshman year at college, and desktop computers were still about a year from being something that everyday consumers could purchase. I wrote “Scary Christmas” on a typewriter. Probably an electric one. I'd started writing on an old manual typewriter that had been sitting around the house, and my parents got me an electric typewriter —a massive upgrade back then—for Christmas. The manuscript of “Scary Christmas” was produced on a typewriter, one that didn't have a correction ribbon. There were a lot of strike-outs on the pages (places where I typed a series of capital X’s to mark out mistakes). Because revising stories took more effort before PC‘s came along, I’m fairly confident this was the first and only draft. I have no memory of ever typing a clean copy and submitting it for publication. Back then I had no idea where to submit a horror story, and there was no Internet for me to research markets. The manuscript has a number of pen and pencil corrections, which I assume meant I proofread the story at least a couple times. Even so, a good amount of spelling and formatting errors remained. I scanned the pages into Word and cleaned up any errors introduced by the scanning, and I inputted any changes I'd indicated on the manuscript. Any mistakes that I failed to catch back then I didn't fix. So any errors that you see in the story aren't new mistakes introduced by my readying the manuscript for publication. They are actual mistakes from that time, mistakes that might well have remained in a final manuscript I would've typed and sent to a magazine editor. So here it is—“Scary Christmas”—just as I wrote it over thirty years ago (god help me). Following it is a critique from my (much) older self, discussing what I think works in the story and what advice for revisions I'd give Young Tim if he were one of my students today. I’lI also discuss what I see of “Tim Waggoner" in this early story, as well as how I've changed as a writer in the decades since I produced it. I'd like to ask you not to judge “Scary Christmas" too harshly as you read it, but I won't. It is pretty damn awful.

Scary Christmas

Jerry painted as he hid in the dim alley. Rats and roaches vied for what little food they could get out of the filth that filled the metal and plastic garbage cans that lined the alley walls. Jerry hoped with all of his might, which was considerable for a sixteen year old, that no one heard the old man scream. The last thing that Jerry needed was to spend Christmas Eve in jail on a murder rap. His heart pounded in his head, the world blurred for a second and Jerry realized that he was crying. Shit, why the hell was he crying over an old drunk? The dumb sonofabitch was asking for it, stumbling out of the bar like that, singing at the top of his lungs, and waving all that money around. Hell, the old man probably had wanted to die; why else would he make himself so conspicuous in the middle of the night in this part of town unless he had a death wish? Jerry froze when he heard the sirens. Seconds became moments and moments became Little subjective eternities as the sound grew and peaked, only to fade away. Jerry released the breath that he had been holding and watched as the winter cold made it visible. He ought to be far enough away by now, Jerry thought, and he took out the crumbled wad of green that had, only a few minutes ago, been in the wallet of a merry old drunk man. Jerry had taken a few seconds to remove the money from the wallet instead of panicking and running with it like so many others did. That was how you got caught. No, Jerry was much sharper than that, much more calculating. If they found the wallet on the body without money they would be suspicious, but Jerry had left a twenty there to throw them off. Twenty dollars was not an unreasonable amount of money for a man to have left on Christmas Eve after spending the night in a bar; indeed, it was more than most left with. Jerry had been careful to move the wallet around in the snow with his shoe to remove or at least blur, his fingerprints. He then used on old piece of newspaper to return the wallet to its proper place in the old man's coat pocket. Jerry knew that all this would have been mere foolishness on his part if he had actually gone through with his plan and bashed the old geezer in the head with the hunk of pipe that he carried for “insurance”. As it was, the drunk was frightened enough by Jerry when he leapt out of the alley that the old man's heart did all the work for him. Not that he thought that the cops wouldn't be able to pin it on him somehow. Not if they knew that he had been there, which Jerry hoped, they never would. Jerry couldn't believe it. When he finished counting he knew that he was now the proud owner of roughly 350 dollars. What that dumb-ass had been doing with that much money around here Jerry would never be able to figure out . . . not in a thousand years. A considerably less amount of time on earth than he had left. Jerry lived by himself in his mother's apartment. She had left six months earlier to move in with some black guy across town. Not that Jerry gave a shit. He hated the bitch anyway. He especially hated the demands she used to make of him...especially when he had hit puberty, but that was something that he didn't like to think about. Yeah, if anyone had asked him, he would've replied that he was glad that his mother was gone. Jerry had stopped on the way home and had bought himself a bottle of whisky. A cheap bottle, but then Jerry would have been unable to tell the difference between good and bad whisky anyway. Besides it all tasted like shit to him. All he cared about was what it did to him. Getting the booze hadn't been a problem. He knew the store owner well enough to know that the old bitch was terrified of him. Jerry, while not the most muscular boy in the city was enough to give people twice his age pause. He stood at six foot even and had broad shoulders, the kind which would’ve made him a good football player. That is if his school had a football team and if he still went to school. Jerry had just about finished climbing up the stairs when a rat, a particularly big and ugly one, which was saying a lot for the building in which Jerry lived, ran across his feet. Startled, Jerry dropped the bottle of whisky, which he had taken a few hits of on the way up the stairs, and watched as his plans for a merry, if numb, Christmas shatter and spill across the floor. He stared at the broken shards for a moment, wondering whether or not to go back to the liquor store and try and scare the old bitch into giving him another bottle. It wasn't worth it, he decided...maybe next week. He still had a handful of pills and a joint or two left in the apartment. He would just have to make due with them. A few hours later Jerry was sleeping of the effects of his little private Christmas party. And in his sleep of stupor and numbness and short circuiting nerves, he dreamed. He saw the old man's face, only this time it was frozen at the exact moment that his heart had decided to give out, and Jerry had the chance to study it in more detail. It was a round face; round and wrinkled. It kind of remind Jerry of a flesh colored orange. One that for some reason, had a nose, eyes, ears and a mouth. Something like a Florida version of Mr. Potato Head. The man’s hair was white and stringy. In way it looked like someone had taken the orange-head and glued old white yarn to it. Jerry would’ve laughed at such a face, if it wasn't for the expression of pure animal terror that lit up the eyes. It was an expression that Jerry had seen before, in the eyes of his brother just before he had died from the knife wound that had sent their father to jail. It was the look that Jerry sometimes saw in rats when he had them trapped. They had that same look in their eyes when they saw Jerry's booted foot coming down on them. Things began to change in Jerry’s dream now. The old man was lying there, just like he had left him; stone cold dead, small piles of snow forming a kind of shroud around him. Then the snow near the old man’s hand stirred. No, the old man’s hand that had stirred. Then before Jerry knew it, the old man was pushing himself, slowly and haltingly to his feet. He stood there like he was dazed or spaced out. Then Jerry saw the old man's face. It was white. Bloodless. Dead. And, if Jerry read the look in the old man's unseeing eyes right, it hated. Jerry awoke with a start. he sat in bed for a second before he realized that he had wet himself. Jerry climbed out of bed and almost fell down. his head was still spinning, partly from the drugs, partly from the dream. Shit, but that had been one mother of a dream! If Jerry had been a little less cynical, he might have thought that the dream was caused from guilt. Jerry never felt guilt. . .not about anything. He stumbled out of one where an old mattress served as his bed and stumbled into the other, which served as everything else. Jerry stumbled once more and this time ended up in a pile on the floor. Luckily he had landed next to what he had come in he looking for. He didn't own a television, but he did have a radio that he had taken from some punk or other. Jerry flipped it on. It was tuned, as it always was to his favorite station. They always played songs about sex and drugs and cars and all the other things that made life worthwhile, Jerry wondered if he had any pills left, then thought better of it. Better lay off for a while, especially after a dream like that! Jerry had seen things before of course when taking drugs. That was part of the fun of it, but somehow, nothing that Jerry had ever seen had seemed as real as that. Jerry dismissed such thoughts from his mind and instead concentrated on a song about girls with big breasts who happened to get off on a particular style of car. Jerry started when he heard someone call his name jerry.....

What the fuck? Had Rico or one of his gang come around here to hassle him! That was just what he needed right now! Jerry got up haltingly and made his way to the door, picking up a ball bat on his way. If Rico wanted to fuck around Jerry would show him some fucking around! Right upside his skull. Jerry stopped and listened at the door. jerry..… 

Now that he was closer, Jerry wasn't sure that there was any voice at all. It sounded more like the wind...or something out of a dream. A dream. Jerry suddenly realized that he was sweating. And shaking. What the hell did he have to be afraid of? Jerry threw open the door, the bat held high. There was nothing there. He looked around for a couple of seconds , until he was satisfied that no one was there. Swearing he closed the door. Lousy dope...Just what until he got his hands on that little punk that sold it to him! A rat stood in the middle of the bare room when Jerry returned. He smiled. Now this was exactly what he needed to take his minds off things! Jerry tightened his grip on the bat and advanced on the rat. He had met some pretty mean rodents in his life here, so he wasn't especially surprised when this one didn’t run. No, this was one of the arrogant ones, the kind that liked to try and stare you down. This was just fine with Jerry. The more arrogant they were the better... all the more fun to watch the little peckers go squish. Jerry raised the bat. This was going to be good. But before he could bring the wooden bat down, the rat had attached itself to Jerry‘s leg and was gnawing away. Dark blood spilled into the rat's mouth and all over the floor. He screamed and swung the ball bat at the rodent only to connect violently with his Leg. Jerry howled as he hit the ground. The rat, who had leapt away at the last minute, went for his eyes. In seconds one eye was a mass of blood. Jerry clawed frantically at his face. He caught the rat and crushed it in his hand. He flung the handful of smashed fur and guts into the wall, where it stuck for a second before sliding to the floor. Tears welled out of the one good eye that he had left. His whole face had gone numb with pain. jerry.....

There it was again, that damn voice! Only this time it filled Jerry with a vague sense of something that he would've once called hope. Whoever it was, maybe they would help him to get to a hospital, or at least call an ambulance. Jerry rose, slipped once on his own blood, and staggered to the door, leaving a trail of gore in his wake. He threw open the door, saying something about help. No one was there... yet Jerry could swear that he still heard the voice. The hole where Jerry’s eye had been was bleeding even more now, and the tears in his other eye obscured his vision. jerry..…

There it was again! Jerry stumbled into the hallway, hoping and for the first time in his life praying, that someone, anyone, was out there. Hell, even Rico would help him now. He'd have to!! Through his haze Jerry thought that he saw someone. Funny, he hadn't a second ago...that didn’t matter though. This person, whoever it was would help him. Jerry was sure of it. Jerry reached out imploringly. “Help...m-me....” The person, the old man, smiled. Jerry's eyes cleared and he saw who it was standing in the hallway. Most of all, Jerry saw the eyes...the eyes from his dream. Dead eyes. Jerry turned to run, blood welling anew, splattering all over, filling his good eye. He turned and ran… He bounced seven times before he died, and nine before he cam to a rest at the bottom of the stairs. The old man stood at the top of the stairs, smiling his grimace of a smile. He looked down at the twisted, wet mess at the bottom of the stairs. “Merry Christmas Jerry...and a Happy New Year." One of the things that surprised me when reading this story was how I wrote with a close, immersive point of view from Jerry‘s perspective. I had no awareness of the concept of immersion in writing fiction back then. I hadn’t read any how-to-write articles or books yet. I wrote based solely on what I'd picked up via osmosis as a reader. My memory of writing fiction thirty-something years ago is that I had trouble providing effective description in my stories. I expected “Scary Christmas" to have this deficit, and while it is extremely far from perfect when it comes to description, it’s not as weak in this area as I thought it would be. I know my other fiction around this time—most of which was either fantasy or science fiction—suffered from a lack of effective point of view and minimal description. It appears that I had learned that both a close point of view and effective description help create good horror. It's too bad that I didn't apply this learning to the other genres I was writing in at the time. And it's too bad that I didn't start seriously focusing on horror for another decade. I clearly had picked up enough about writing horror that I could’ve built on. Stephen King was the main horror writer I read back then, so I’m sure I picked up writing with a close point of view from his work. There are several places in the story where I put in authorial statements—such as “A considerably less amount of time on earth than he had left”—in a few places, something that King does in his third person narratives. This is something that I, as Older Tim (I refuse to think of myself as old just yet) would advise Young Tim to avoid. Such authorial intrusion breaks the illusion of reality for readers. Plus, it's an obvious, simplistic attempt to create suspense and tension. I was attempting foreshadowing in these places, and that's good. But I could’ve found better ways to do it. That said, if I use authorial intrusions like that now—which I sometimes do in novels, but sparingly—I place them at the end of scenes or chapters. Since we're leaving a character's point of view at the end of a scene or chapter, an authorial intrusion (which often is a hint at future events) is like a movie camera that was focused on a close-up of a character but then pulls back for a long shot as the scene ends. But like I said, I use this technique very sparingly now, although I still do use it. Not only does that bit of authorial foreshadowing break Jerry’s point of view, it's also dumb. If Jerry’s death is the climax of the story, why the hell would I want to forecast the ending so clearly? I suppose readers might read on to find out how Jerry dies, but it's not like they couldn't guess the ending since the basic plot is such a cliché (more on this later). So, the strengths of the story: close point of view and description that was more detailed than I'd expected. I also stay in the moment throughout the story (mostly), dramatizing events instead of simply summarizing them or presenting a simple dry recitation of this happens, then this happens, then this other thing happens. There's a conscious use of language to create effect—word choice, sentence variety and rhythm (even if they're not highly developed) and a sense of pacing as well. The bit about Jerry trying to obscure fingerprints on the wallet shows that I was thinking ahead, thinking about what a person in Jerry's situation might actually do. Many beginning writers fail to do this, leaving their characters to act unrealistically. I have a focused horror image in the story—the old man's ghost—and I keep him mostly offstage during the story. I also attempt to create a sense of building dread (even if it is done in a cliched way). I also have some good gory details in the story, although blood and guts hardly make up for a story's deficits by themselves. I focused on more than sound and movement, which is good, and this definitely wasn't a script Young Tim was trying to pass off as a short story (which happens on a regular basis in my creative writing classes).
So if I received this story from a student today, I'd know that he has an overall sense of narrative, of how to use words to tell a story to an audience. I would be confident that he had enough raw talent and nascent skill to write successful fiction one day—if he kept working his ass off. Now let's talk about the not-so-good stuff. I've already mentioned the clumsy authorial foreshadowing. Luckily, I only did it a couple times. Otherwise, I remain solidly in Jerry‘s point of view. But there are several huge problems. First of all, Jerry's an unlikable asshole. Why should readers give a damn what happens to him? He's not even an interesting asshole. I was surprised by Jerry's characterization, primarily because as a teacher I've seen hundreds of stories written by young men in their twenties who write about the same basic character. Always pissed off and aggrieved, usually living in shabby conditions, focused on booze, drugs, and sex, with at least hints of racism and misogyny. These characters don't seem to have jobs or any purpose or direction in their lives. (Most Jerrys usually have a friend to bitch to, but my Jerry is a loner.) I have no idea what this means. Maybe new adult males go through a kind of post-adolescent development stage where they're basically jerks? Whatever the reason for it, if I were an editor and received this as a submission, I'd think Not another goddamned Jerry story! I'm sure editors, like creative writing teachers, see a lot of this kind of character. I made another mistake with the portrayal of Jerry. Because I was attempting to write a dark story, I made everything about him dark and unlikable. I was trying to create an overall mood/atmosphere of emotional darkness throughout the story, and while that instinct wasn’t a bad one, the way I went about it doesn't work at all. In fact, it would drive away readers. Your characters don't have to be unrealistically good and pure, but there should be something about them that engenders reader sympathy. If nothing else, there should be something interesting about them, something that grabs, holds, and rewards reader attention. Jerry’s got nothing in that department.
I was also writing primarily from my imagination. I grew up a middle-class kid who wasn’t abused in any way (as I hint Jerry was sexually abused by his mom), nor was there any violence in my family (Jerry's brother went to prison for killing his father). I don't think I’d ever been drunk yet, and I hadn't tasted anything stronger than beer. I also hadn't done drugs. (I've never done drugs, but I did drink like a damn fish while in college as soon as I turned twenty-one.) I'd never been anyplace where the conditions were rough, like where Jerry lives. I don't know if I'd ever seen a rat in real life. Everything about this story comes from stuff I’d seen on TV and in the movies. It didn't come from actual experience, what some writers call earned experience. Because of this, none of Jerry’s emotions came from a real place. You don’t have to write thinly disguised autobiography all the time, but there needs to be some reality, some authenticity to your fiction. If nothing else, you need to learn how to convincingly fake authenticity. There are some signs here that I'm working toward that—the close point of view helps—but it would have been far more effective if I had written from a real place inside myself back then, instead of writing a simple idea story that would’ve been at home in horror comics like House of Mystery. Which brings me to another big problem with the story. It’s a cliche from start to finish. It’s a simple ghost-gets-revenge story that does absolutely nothing new or interesting with the trope. Creepshow, the anthology film by Stephen King and George Romero, came out in 1982. I wonder if I'd seen it and been influenced by it. The stories in the film all have that pulpy EC Comics feel. So if Young Tim was my student today, I'd tell him the same thing Dr. Huberman once told me. Don't write standard horror shit. Try to write about your own weird thoughts, feelings, fears, desires, obsessions, and observations. There's little of Tim the individual in this story. I’m not sure why I picked this idea to base a story on. In general, I find ghosts to be ineffective horror tropes to work with. Their existence proves there's life after death. So if they kill someone, all they do is deliver that soul into eternal life a bit faster. Plus, once the victim is a ghost, too, couldn't he or she go after their killer? Wouldn't the victim have the same ghostly strengths and abilities? And as far as motives for revenge go, the ghost‘s is pretty thin in this story. I think I originally intended for Jerry to kill the old man before robbing him, but I decided that would make Jerry too unsympathetic, so I had the old man just die on his own from a heart attack. I under-explained big-time when Jerry falls down the stairs. I originally had more to the line He turned and ran. I had an ellipsis (evidently I was extremely fond of those back then) and then came the words right into the stairs. But for some reason, I crossed them out. Why the hell I'd do that, I have no idea. Maybe the word into bugged me. But I could’ve changed it to onto or said He ran toward the stairs without thinking or In his blind panic, he ran toward the stairs. But I didn't, and readers are treated to a description of Jerry falling down something that isn't named until after he lands at the bottom. Maybe I was hoping to make this more a shock for readers? I remember struggling back then with how much information I needed to provide to make story events clear for readers and how much was over-explaining. Whatever I was trying to do in this passage, it clearly didn’t work. Regarding the rat attack: I believe this was supposed to be caused by the old man’s vengeful ghost, but I didn't make that clear. My guess is that this was another point I didn't want to over-explain, that I thought readers would just get. If so, I was wrong. A huge problem is that Jerry’s death has no emotional impact for readers. He’s not sympathetic and a short story isn't enough time for readers to come to care for him. That's why having your main character die at the end of a story is not only cliche, it almost never has the effect you want it to have on readers. In a novel, there's time to get to know characters, time for readers to become attached to them. Then if they die, their deaths have the potential to affect readers, perhaps deeply. Another problem is that besides Jerry, five characters are mentioned: the old man, Jerry’s mother, brother, father, and Rico. There's arguably a sixth, when Jerry thinks about the “little punk" that sold him "lousy dope." And Rico's gang is mentioned at one point, and who knows how many of them there might be? The problem isn't the number of characters mentioned. The problem is that Jerry is never shown interacting with any of them. Interactions between characters reveal who they are, can provide information, strengthen the overall atmosphere of conflict in a story, help create vivid scenes, help establish and vary story rhythm. In Jerry’s case, such interactions might have portrayed him in a more sympathetic light to readers. If Young Tim was my student, I'd suggest giving Jerry one other character to interact with. Maybe a friend or lover with whom he planned and/or carried out the robbery with. Someone to share his guilt and his burgeoning fear as ghostly events start occurring. Or maybe someone he goes to for help. Again, a friend, maybe a former lover this time. Maybe this person could be attacked or even killed by the old man’s ghost as a stronger warning to Jerry of what's to come. I tried to create a sense of building dread by having Jerry hear the old man’s ghost whispering his name. If I were to write this story today, I’d have people around Jerry speak the old man’s words, taunting Jerry now and again, without realizing they were doing so. That would dramatize the communication more effectively and probably freak out Jerry more. Jerry has no relationship with the old man. If he'd been at least previously acquainted with the old man—or better yet, had some kind of prior relationship with him, even if it wasn't a deep one—the story would be much stronger. Hell, they could be relatives. The old man could be Jerry’s uncle or grandfather, maybe even his estranged father (who wouldn't be dead in this version). Having a connection to the old man could also create conflicted emotions about what Jerry does to the old man. As the story currently stands, Jerry has no internal conflict about his actions whatsoever. The inciting incident in the story—Jerry's robbing the old man—isn’t dramatized in the story. I started after that, which wasn't a bad instinct. Starting in media res is in general a good idea, especially in a short story. I'd definitely suggest that Young Tim should have Jerry attack the old man in a revision—to give Jerry more opportunity to feel guilt and to give the ghost a stronger motivation for revenge than Some punk took my cash after I died of a heart attack. And why the hell was the old man carrying so much money on his person? This was back before debit cards, and while credit cards were a thing, they were used more sparingly. So maybe he’d have a wad of cash on him, but there needs to be reason. Young Tim only had one reason: he needed the old man to have a somewhat substantial amount of money for Jerry to take to get the story rolling. Showing the attack—and showing Jerry’s conflicted feelings as he goes about it, maybe even killing the old man by accident—could work quite well in this story. Still another problem: Jerry has no motivation for what he does in the story. Why does he need money so badly that he's willing to rob someone? Just because he’s a bad guy? There needs to be a stronger, more interesting motivation for Jerry to take such a drastic step as attacking another person. (And why doesn't Jerry just sell drugs, maybe as a member of Rico's gang? If you can’t beat 'em, join ’em.) Jerry wets himself from fright at one point in the story. I had no idea how much of a cliche that is in horror fiction. It's an overused, cheap way to show deep, primal fear in a character. And here's a biggie . . . Why the hell is the story set at Christmas? Christmas has nothing to do with the story. It could take place any time of the year. I have a dim memory of coming up with the title first. Or maybe I came up with the ghost’s departing line first. Either way, I suspect that I wanted to create a story simply to match those, and I neglected to actually make Christmas an integral part of the story. But the biggest problem with this story—among many-is that there's no emotional core. None whatsoever. I'd advise Young Tim to find some kind of primary emotion to base the story on, one that’s not simply fear. Characters in horror stories may experience fear, but the stories aren't about fear. They may be about grief or regret or shame or desire or any of a thousand different emotions. And when horror stories are about fear, they’re about fear of something. Fear of intimacy, fear of loss, fear of having a secret revealed, fear of rejection, fear of anything other than just generic, unspecified fear.
Formatting is a huge issue. For godsakes, I didn't put my name on the story! I don’t think I had any idea that there was such a thing as manuscript formatting back then. At one point, I stopped indenting paragraphs, and I know that I knew to do that. There were no page numbers on the original manuscript, either. I wouldn’t give a student this detailed a critique. It would be too overwhelming and demoralizing. I'd have him or her work on improving three or four big issues in the story. But I don’t have to be as gentle with Young Tim. I’d tell him to throw out this story and start on a fresh one. Often the problems with a story lie in the foundation and they can't be fixed. Better to start with a new idea, a new foundation, and build from there. I've already mentioned adding an emotional core. I'd suggest finding a different approach to the Ghost Seeks Revenge on Its Killer trope. Horror fans read a lot of horror fiction and watch a lot of horror films. Whatever you write, you need to repay your readers’ time and attention (which I've stressed several times before in this book). “Scary Christmas" doesn't do that. But if Young Tim could’ve found a way to put a spin on the trope—one drawn from his own unique experience and imagination—it would go a long way to improving this story. I guess I shouldn't be too hard on Young Tim. He eventually found his way as a writer. I wish the same for you, wherever you're at on your journey. Hopefully, your learning curve won't be quite as steep as mine. This is a list of general story types and situations that can not only help generate ideas for stories, but also give you ideas for story patterns that go beyond the usual predator-prey paradigm that a lot of horror stories follow I wrote the situations down as they occurred to me.
